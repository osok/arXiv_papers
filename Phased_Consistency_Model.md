# SUMMARY
The Phased Consistency Model (PCM) addresses limitations in image and video generation models, offering improved consistency, controllability, and efficiency over existing methods.

# IDEAS:
- PCM addresses limitations of current models like inconsistency, lack of controllability, and inefficiency in image sampling.
- Diffusion models are commonly used for generative image synthesis but are time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- Consistency models reduce the number of steps needed for sample generation by enforcing self-consistency.
- Latent Consistency Models (LCMs) struggle with consistency, controllability, and efficiency during image sampling.
- PCM divides the trajectory into sub-trajectories to enforce self-consistency within each sub-trajectory.
- PCM allows for deterministic sampling without error accumulation by training with two sub-trajectories and specific edge points.
- PCM can utilize larger guidance for inference and respond better to prompts than LCMs.
- PCM incorporates an adversarial loss in the latent space for more precise supervision in low-step settings.
- Experimental results demonstrate PCM's effectiveness on various image and video generation benchmarks.
- PCM phases the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories to enforce self-consistency.
- PCM removes the CFG strategy to enhance text guidance controllability.
- PCM introduces an adversarial consistency loss for efficient modeling of data distribution.
- The main framework of PCM involves defining solution trajectories of a diffusion model.
- PCM splits trajectories into sub-trajectories, parameterizes consistency functions, and introduces a phased consistency distillation objective.
- Guided distillation uses the Epsilon prediction format with text conditions.
- Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a common strategy for text-conditioned diffusion models.
- CFG augmented prediction is necessary for ODE solvers to address the exposure problem.
- Splitting the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories reduces the negative impact of prompts.
- Adversarial loss forces distribution consistency, enhancing generation results in low-step scenarios.
- The final optimization objective combines distribution consistency and instance consistency controlled by a hyperparameter Lambda.
- Experiments evaluate PCM's performance using different datasets for training and evaluation.
- PCM outperforms other methods in terms of image quality and alignment across different steps.
- In one-step generation, PCM shows superior performance compared to other methods.
- In multi-step generation, PCM consistently performs well as the number of steps increases.
- For video generation, PCM achieves consistently better results than comparison methods.
- Ablation studies analyze sensitivity to negative prompts, consistent generation ability, and adversarial consistency design effectiveness.
