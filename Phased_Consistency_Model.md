# SUMMARY
The Phased Consistency Model (PCM) addresses limitations in image and video generation models by improving consistency, controllability, and efficiency through phased sub-trajectories and adversarial loss.

# IDEAS:
- PCM addresses limitations of current models like inconsistency, lack of controllability, and inefficiency in image sampling.
- Diffusion models are commonly used for generative image synthesis but are time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- Consistency models reduce the number of steps needed for sample generation by enforcing self-consistency.
- Latent Consistency Models (LCMs) struggle with consistency, controllability, and efficiency during image sampling.
- PCM divides the trajectory into sub-trajectories to enforce self-consistency within each sub-trajectory.
- Deterministic sampling without error accumulation is achieved by training PCM with two sub-trajectories and specific edge points.
- PCM can utilize larger guidance for inference and respond better to prompts than LCMs.
- PCM incorporates an adversarial loss in the latent space for more precise supervision in low-step settings.
- Experimental results demonstrate PCM's effectiveness on various image and video generation benchmarks.
- PCM phases the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories to enforce self-consistency.
- PCM removes the CFG strategy to enhance text guidance controllability.
- An adversarial consistency loss is introduced to enforce the modeling of data distribution.
- The main framework of PCM involves defining solution trajectories of a diffusion model.
- Each sub-trajectory is treated as an independent consistency model ensuring consistent outputs.
- Parameterization involves gradually adjusting coefficients to maintain consistency.
- A training loss function minimizes the ODE solver cost and ensures accurate solution estimation.
- Randomness in sampling can improve generation results.
- Guided distillation uses the Epsilon prediction format with text conditions.
- Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a common strategy for text-conditioned diffusion models.
- CFG augmented prediction reduces the negative impact of prompts.
- Splitting the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories reduces the negative impact of CFG.
- An adversarial loss penalizes the distribution distance using a GAN-style training paradigm.
- The final optimization objective combines distribution consistency and instance consistency.
- Experiments use different datasets for training and evaluation, including CC3M, COCO 2014, and WebVid D2N.
- PCM outperforms other methods like InstaFlow, LCM, CTM, and SD Turbo in image generation.
- For video generation, PCM achieves better results than methods like DDIM, DPM, and Animate LCM.
- Ablation studies analyze sensitivity to negative prompts and the effectiveness of adversarial consistency design.
