# SUMMARY
The paper discusses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which address knowledge conflicts in language models by combining generative models with non-parametric data stores.

# IDEAS:
- RAG systems solve knowledge conflicts between parametric and contextual information in language models.
- RAG combines a generative language model with a non-parametric data store for knowledge updates.
- It updates a system's world knowledge without costly retraining.
- RAG allows language models to rely on factual information from retrieved documents.
- It enables models to update their knowledge according to real-world contexts.
- RAG excels in solving knowledge-intensive tasks and modeling longtail knowledge.
- It provides attribution of generated text to identified sources.
- Useful in scenarios where pre-training data may become obsolete.
- Downstream tasks require different factual knowledge or large-scale text corpora contain untrustworthy information.
- Enhances performance and adapts to new information without limitations of purely parametric models.
- The method involves a three-stage experimental framework.
- Stage one: closed book answer gathering to probe parametric knowledge.
- Stage two: filtering out no-conflict examples to create a knowledge conflict dataset.
- Stage three: open book QA under knowledge conflict with context.
- Answers categorized into correct update, retain parametric, and incorrect update sets.
- Experiments run on various open-book QA datasets using different LLM models.
- Evaluation metric used is BEM instead of exact match for precise evaluation.
- Models tend to update their knowledge correctly with factual documents.
- A small percentage retain their parametric answers.
- Parametric bias negatively influences the model's reading ability.
- Masking the parametric answer reduces the probability of retaining it.
- Adding the parametric answer to the context increases the likelihood of retaining it.
- RAG systems update a model's world knowledge without costly retraining.
- They allow flexibility in incorporating new information without starting from scratch.
- Crucial in scenarios where factual information may become obsolete over time.
- RAG systems excel in solving knowledge-intensive tasks and modeling longtail knowledge.
- They provide attribution of generated text to identified sources, enhancing transparency and credibility.
- Mitigate the risk of using untrustworthy information from large-scale text corpora.
- Incorporate domain-specific and reliable information from retrieved documents.
- Offer a dynamic and adaptable approach to updating a model's knowledge base.
