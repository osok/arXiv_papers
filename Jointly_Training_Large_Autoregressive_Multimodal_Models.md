# SUMMARY
Researchers introduce a multimodal model combining autoregressive text-to-image models with large language models (LLMs) to generate integrated text and image outputs using the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework.

# IDEAS:
- Autoregressive text-to-image models generate detailed images similar to diffusion models.
- Large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text-based tasks but lack multimodal output capabilities.
- Multimodal large models aim to combine vision and language strengths but still generate one type of output.
- The study develops a multimodal model generating both text and image outputs.
- The JAM framework leverages architectural compatibility of text-to-image models with LLMs.
- The solution is modular and data-efficient, using less than 1% of original pre-training data.
- The study demonstrates merging autoregressive text-to-image models with LLMs into a unified architecture.
- Innovative strategies for multimodal instruction tuning using text-based instructions are presented.
- The model can generate long-form content with interleaved text and images.
- The primary image-text model, CM3 Leon, is trained on 2.4 trillion image-text caption tokens.
- The LLM is trained on 1.4 trillion text tokens, both models having 7 billion parameters.
- JAM Uniform averages the weights of the two models, while JAM Width initializes a wider architecture.
- Cross-attention layers between base models enable smooth information exchange.
- The two-way cross-attention mechanism allows layers to pay attention to corresponding layers in the other model.
- Multimodal conversational instruct tuning enhances large pre-trained models' capabilities.
- Instruction tuning tailored to interleaved image-text generation uses a small curated mixed modal dataset.
- The model quickly learns the style of images and text from a small curated dataset.
- The CM3 objective allows for optional bi-directional processing and enhances model flexibility.
- Multimodal retrieval augmentation uses a dense retriever and specific retrieval strategy.
- Mixed modal decoding strategy employs temperature sampling, top sampling, and classifier-free guidance.
- Text corpora include English Common Crawl, C4, Wikipedia, Books3, and Archive.
- Image-text pairs are collected from 3000 articles on wikiHow with high community ratings.
- JAM Cross model performs best, highlighting the strength of bi-directional cross-attention mechanism.
- Retrieval augmented JAM Cross model generates high-quality coherent and interleaved image-text responses.
- Generative text-to-image models have been dominated by diffusion models recently.
- Retrieval augmentation significantly boosts training efficiency for text-to-image generative models.
- Flamingo introduces cross-attention into a frozen LLM to inject visual features.
- Instruction tuning teaches language models to follow natural language instructions.
- Lima demonstrated that 1000 carefully curated samples achieve competitive results in instruction tuning.
