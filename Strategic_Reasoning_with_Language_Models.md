- The study aims to improve AI algorithms to think strategically and flexibly like humans.
- Large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding complex, context-specific information.
- LLMs can be shaky and inconsistent in social situations and strategic planning.
- The approach involves providing LLMs with examples of strategic reasoning.
- Key elements for AI strategic reasoning: navigating states/actions, assigning values, and forming beliefs.
- An automated prompt compiler generates examples of strategic reasoning for LLMs.
- The study tests the approach with matrix games and negotiation games.
- The goal is to highlight the model's ability to navigate, assign values, and form beliefs in new contexts.
