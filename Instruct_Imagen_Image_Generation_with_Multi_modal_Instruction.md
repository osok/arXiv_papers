# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "Instruct Imagine," a model for image generation using multimodal instructions. It enhances text-to-image models by integrating various elements like sketches and styles, achieving superior results in complex tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Generative AI is advancing in image generation, especially through text-to-image models.
- Current models struggle with complex instructions involving multiple elements.
- Human art creation integrates various elements, making it inherently multimodal.
- Communicating these multimodal complexities to models is challenging.
- Multimodal instruction enhances language instructions by integrating information from other elements.
- Instruct Imagine uses a two-stage training approach to process multimodal instructions.
- The model excels in merging diverse modal inputs with textual directives.
- Instruct Imagine generalizes well to unseen and complex image generation tasks.
- Multimodal instruction universally represents instructions from multiple elements.
- Retrieval-augmented training adapts pre-trained text-to-image models to follow multimodal instructions.
- Instruct Imagine surpasses several state-of-the-art models in their domains.
- Diffusion models are trained to learn the image distribution by reversing the diffusion process.
- Multimodal instruction format uses language to explicitly state the objective behind tasks.
- The model employs a shared instruction understanding model to consume both text and multimodal context.
- Instruct Imagine extends pre-existing text-to-image diffusion models.
- The model uses a convolutional UNet with a bottleneck paired with a downsampling encoder and upsampling decoder.
- Training involves two stages: text-to-image generation with augmented neighbor pairs and fine-tuning on diverse tasks.
- Human evaluation protocol includes semantic consistency and perceptual quality scores.
- Instruct Imagine performs well in both in-domain and zero-shot evaluations.
- The model efficiently manages compositional tasks by leveraging combined instructions.
- Retrieval-augmented training aids generalization in both in-domain and zero-shot evaluations.
- Instruct Imagine can edit images when fine-tuned but introduces artifacts in high-resolution outputs.
- The model struggles with complex multimodal instructions involving at least three conditions.
- Future work aims to develop diffusion models that operate at raw image resolution.
