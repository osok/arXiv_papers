# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the development of AutoWeb GLM, a deployable webpage browsing agent based on the ChatGLM 3-6B model, designed to autonomously accomplish complex real-world missions by navigating and operating on real web browsers like humans.

# IDEAS:
- AutoWeb GLM aims to create a deployable webpage browsing agent based on the ChatGLM 3-6B model.
- It addresses the lack of a unified action space and webpage simplification method.
- The scarcity of high-quality training trajectories for LLM-based web agents is a key challenge.
- Efficient data strategies and training methods like supervised and reinforcement learning are leveraged.
- The goal is to optimize webpage comprehension, enhance interactive capacity, and improve navigation precision.
- AutoWeb GLM differs from WebGLM by focusing on autonomous real-world missions.
- WebGLM focuses on retrieval-augmented web-scale question answering.
- AutoWeb GLM amalgamates components into a singular framework for robust web browsing.
- It introduces rejection sampling fine-tuning for lifelong learning in specific web environments.
- Observation space includes task description, simplified HTML, current location, and past operation records.
- Task description helps the model understand the objective of the task.
- Simplified HTML provides structural and content information about the webpage.
- Current location information assists the model in understanding its position on the web page.
- Past operation records offer historical context for generating consistent subsequent operations.
- A unified observation space maximizes the model's capabilities by mimicking browser interface information.
- Action space includes potential browsing operations like click, scroll, and type.
- State transition is determined by the current webpage state and the agent's output action.
- The task ends when the agent outputs finish or reaches the maximum number of interactions.
- Challenges in constructing the training data set include task collection, privacy and security, and objective annotation.
- A hybrid human-AI data construction method is proposed to address these challenges.
- Training involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning, and rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT).
- SFT trains the model to comprehend web pages and perform basic operations.
- Reinforcement learning enhances the model's ability to operate the browser and infer tasks accurately.
- Rejection sampling fine-tuning optimizes the model for specific webpage environments.
- AutoWeb GLM excels in predicting general user operation patterns on various benchmarks.
