# SUMMARY
Researchers introduce GSM 1K, a new benchmark of 1250 grade school math problems, to assess overfitting in large language models (LLMs) and ensure accurate evaluation.

# IDEAS:
- Enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs is a crucial area of current research.
- Public benchmarks like GSM 8K, Math, MBPP, HumanEval, and SBench are commonly used.
- Concerns exist that LLMs may memorize answers from training data, skewing benchmark results.
- GSM 1K was created to address data contamination issues in existing benchmarks.
- GSM 1K contains 1250 grade school math problems similar to GSM 8K.
- Problems in GSM 1K were created solely by human annotators without LLM input.
- Various LLMs were evaluated on GSM 1K, revealing signs of overfitting.
- The worst-performing model scored 133% lower on GSM 1K compared to GSM 8K.
- Certain model families, like Mistol and Fi, consistently exhibit overfitting.
- Spearman's correlation (r = 0.32) suggests models may memorize examples from GSM 8K.
- Cutting-edge models and Llama 2 family showed minimal signs of overfitting.
- All models demonstrated the ability to generalize to new grade school math problems.
- GSM 1K will not be released publicly to prevent future data contamination.
- Evaluation code will be made open source for reproducibility.
- GSM 1K will be released when top open-source models achieve over 95% accuracy or by end of 2025.
- Human annotators from Scale AI generated problems for GSM 1K.
- Problems were designed to be solved using basic arithmetic operations.
- Rigorous quality checks ensured correctness and proper formatting of problems.
- Human crowd workers struggled to differentiate between GSM 8K and GSM 1K problems.
- Pre-existing language models like GPT Neo 20B and GPT-2 showed minimal performance differences between datasets.
- Overfit models can still reason effectively despite memorizing training data answers.
- Data contamination alone may not fully explain overfitting in LLMs.
- Advanced models show minimal overfitting despite known training data containing test instances.
- Other factors beyond data leakage may contribute to overfitting in LLMs.
