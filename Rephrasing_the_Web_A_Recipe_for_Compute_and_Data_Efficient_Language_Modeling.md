# SUMMARY
The text discusses the challenges of data curation for pre-training large language models (LLMs) and introduces Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) as a solution. WRAP rephrases web documents using a medium-sized LLM to improve training efficiency, outperforming models trained with larger datasets.

- High-quality data is scarce, and using the same data repeatedly can lead to diminishing returns.
- Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs.
- Generating synthetic data can be expensive and may introduce biases.
- Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) aims to address data curation challenges.
- WRAP uses a medium-sized LLM to rephrase web documents, improving learning efficiency.
- Rephrasing web documents helps avoid factual errors and biases.
- WRAP improves performance on diverse datasets with less data and computing power.
- Models trained with synthetic data outperform those trained with more data and resources.
- WRAP reduces perplexity on the Pile dataset by 50%.
- Data curation methods include heuristic filters, distilling high-quality datasets, and automatic filtering.
- Synthetic data can help models perform better on tasks requiring reasoning and coding.
- Over-reliance on synthetic data can lead to performance issues.
- WRAP leverages the diversity of web articles to generate high-quality paraphrases.
- Rephrasing styles include easy, medium, hard, and question-answer formats.
- Instruction-tuned models are used for rephrasing web documents.
- Mixing real and synthetic data can enhance model performance.
