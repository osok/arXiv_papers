# SUMMARY
The text discusses the evaluation and improvement of large language models (LLMs) for generating high-quality, trustworthy outputs. It focuses on reducing sequence-level scoring to token-level scoring using self-evaluation tasks, improving quality calibration, and leveraging human feedback.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast text corpora and fine-tuned for specific instructions.
- Trustworthiness of LLM outputs is crucial for safe deployment in real-world applications.
- Distance to training distribution in embedding space can predict output quality for generative models.
- Extracting embeddings from well-integrated LLM systems requires significant engineering effort.
- Sequence probability or length-normalized sequence probabilities don't reliably rank outputs by quality.
- Human feedback can fine-tune LLMs to better align with human-judged quality.
- Self-evaluation ability of LLMs can improve quality calibration without expensive human feedback.
- Token-level probability is well-calibrated for multiple-choice and true/false questions.
- Evaluating generation with token-level probabilities might be better than sequence-level likelihood.
- Reducing sequence-level scoring to token-level scoring improves quality calibration.
- Free-form generation can be converted to multiple-choice and true/false tasks for better calibration.
- Adding "none of the above" as an option helps mitigate overconfident predictions.
- Calibration AU and selective AU are metrics for evaluating confidence scores in selective generation.
- Sequence-level likelihood is biased towards sequence length, underestimating longer sentences.
- Length normalization improves performance but still has limitations.
- Hybrid strategies combining token-level scores and self-evaluation improve overall performance.
- Self-evaluation complements self-critique and revise techniques for improving answer quality.
- Position bias in answer ordering has a minimal effect on performance.
- Previous work focused more on accuracy rather than confidence estimation or calibration.
- Self-evaluation increases inference time but enhances quality calibration.
- Future work aims to enhance quality calibration during training and fine-tuning stages.

# INSIGHTS:
- Trustworthiness of LLM outputs is essential for safe real-world applications.
- Token-level probabilities are better calibrated than sequence-level probabilities for quality assessment.
- Human feedback fine-tunes LLMs to align with human judgment, improving output quality.
- Self-evaluation tasks reduce sequence-level scoring to token-level scoring, enhancing calibration.
- Hybrid strategies combining token-level scores and self-evaluation yield the best performance.
