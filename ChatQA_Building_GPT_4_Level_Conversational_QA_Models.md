# SUMMARY
The paper introduces CH AQ q a7b, a conversational QA model matching GP4's accuracy through a two-step instruction tuning process, improved retriever, and meticulous data curation.

# IDEAS:
- Conversational QA models allow users to interact in a conversational manner.
- These models generate answers without needing specific fine-tuning for each data set.
- They can incorporate retrieved information in both open domain or long document settings.
- Creating a conversational QA model matching top-tier models like GP4 is challenging.
- CH AQ q a7b matches GP4's accuracy through a two-step instruction tuning process.
- The model uses an improved retriever for retrieval augmented generation in conversational QA.
- A meticulous data curation process enhances the language model's ability to integrate context.
- The method outperforms regular instruction tuning or RHF-based methods for retrieval augmented generation.
- Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-turn query retrievers on multi-turn QA data is effective.
- The chat QA 70b model outperforms GPT 3.5 turbo and GPT 4 in average score without synthetic data.
- Adding unanswerable samples in instruction tuning reduces hallucination in conversational QA.
- Instruction tuning has become key in building state-of-the-art dialogue agents.
- Context enhanced instruction tuning improves the model's ability to handle context-aware QA.
- Synthetic data generation using GPT 3.5 turbo creates high-quality data sets for fine-tuning.
- Fine-tuning a single-turn retriever using conversational query and context pairs is effective.
- Query rewriting methods are compared to fine-tuning methods for conversational retrieval.
- Fine-tuning performs better than query rewriting on the E5 unsupervised model.
- Using human annotated data leads to significant improvements on certain data sets.
- Human evaluations confirm the strong performance of the model compared to GPT 4.
- Incorporating retrieved top K chunks during training enhances performance on retrieval-based data sets.
- More contexts don't always lead to better results; top five contexts are optimal.
- The order of context chunks affects results; sequential order is effective.
- Fine-tuned retrievers improve average scores compared to non-fine-tuned versions.
- Models more accurate with unanswerable samples tend to be less accurate with answerable samples.
- Adding unanswerable samples improves overall conversational QA score.

- Instruction tuning is crucial for building effective dialogue agents without prior training.
- Context enhanced instruction tuning significantly improves context-aware QA capabilities.
- Synthetic data generation can create high-quality data sets for fine-tuning language models.
- Fine-tuning single-turn retrievers on multi-turn data is as effective as using top-tier models.
- Human annotated data improves performance on unanswerable cases, enhancing overall accuracy.
- Incorporating retrieved top K chunks during training balances context handling in long documents.
- Optimal context chunk order and number are critical for effective answer extraction.
- Fine-tuned retrievers significantly enhance question answering performance over non-fine-tuned versions.
- Balancing answerable and unanswerable sample accuracy is key for robust QA models.
