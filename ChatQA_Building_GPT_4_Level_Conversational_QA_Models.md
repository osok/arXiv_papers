# SUMMARY
The paper introduces CH AQ q a7b, a conversational QA model matching GP4's accuracy through a two-step instruction tuning process, improved retriever, and meticulous data curation.

# IDEAS:
- Conversational QA models allow users to interact in a conversational manner.
- These models generate answers without needing specific fine-tuning for each data set.
- They can incorporate retrieved information in both open domain or long document settings.
- Creating a conversational QA model matching top-tier models like GP4 is challenging.
- CH AQ q a7b matches GP4's accuracy through a two-step instruction tuning process.
- An improved retriever enhances retrieval augmented generation in conversational QA.
- A meticulous data curation process significantly enhances the language model's ability.
- The method outperforms regular instruction tuning or RHF-based methods.
- Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-turn query retrievers on multi-turn QA data is effective.
- Chat QA 70b outperforms GPT 3.5 turbo and GPT 4 in terms of average score.
- Adding unanswerable samples in instruction tuning reduces hallucination.
- Conversational QA improves user experiences by addressing follow-up questions.
- Many conversational QA data sets involve retrieval augmented generation in open domain settings.
- Query rewriting methods rewrite the latest turn of question to be standalone queries.
- Two-stage instruction tuning method improves context-aware or retrieval augmented generation.
- Stage one involves supervised fine-tuning on a blend of instruction following and dialogue data sets.
- Stage two integrates contextualized QA data sets into the instruction tuning blend.
- Human annotated con vqa consists of 7,000 dialogues based on diverse topics.
- Synthetic con vqa generated using GPT 3.5 turbo includes 7,000 multi-turn QA dialogues.
- Fine-tuning a single-term retriever using conversational query and context pairs is proposed.
- Fine-tuning performs better than query rewriting in terms of average top5 recall.
- Chat QA models show significant improvement over SFT and chat models.
- Human annotated data leads to significant improvements on certain data sets.
- Incorporating retrieved top K chunks during training enhances performance on retrieval-based data sets.
- Using more context doesn't always lead to better results; top five contexts are optimal.
- Fine-tuned retrievers improve average scores significantly compared to non-fine-tuned versions.
- Models more accurate with unanswerable samples tend to be less accurate with answerable samples.

# INSIGHTS:
- Conversational QA models enhance user interaction by allowing follow-up questions and clarifications.
- Instruction tuning without specific fine-tuning maintains high accuracy across diverse data sets.
- Two-stage instruction tuning significantly improves context-aware conversational QA capabilities.
- Fine-tuning single-turn query retrievers on multi-turn data is as effective as top-tier models.
- Adding unanswerable samples in training reduces hallucination and improves model reliability.
- Human annotated data provides higher quality for unanswerable cases, improving overall performance.
- Incorporating retrieved top K chunks during training balances context handling in long documents.
- Optimal context chunk retrieval (top five) enhances answer extraction without overwhelming the model.
- Fine-tuned retrievers significantly enhance performance compared to non-fine-tuned versions.
- Balancing continuous context and retrieved chunks is crucial for optimal model performance.
