# SUMMARY
The text explores how the GPT Neo 125m model memorizes paragraphs, focusing on localization, perturbation, and unlearning of memorized information. 

# IDEAS:
- Memorized paragraphs are sequences of 100 tokens where the model predicts the next 50 tokens accurately.
- Perturbing individual tokens in memorized paragraphs is more challenging than in non-memorized ones.
- Unlearning memorized information is easier than editing it in the model.
- Attention head 2 in layer one focuses on rare tokens in the token distribution.
- Smaller models like GPT Neo 125m are easier to analyze at the level of individual weights.
- The Pile dataset consists of a large amount of English text and code.
- Exact match (M) and negative log likelihood (NLL) metrics are used to identify memorized paragraphs.
- Memorized tokens are more ingrained in the model compared to non-memorized tokens.
- Larger gradients are observed for non-memorized sets compared to memorized sets.
- Gradient flow in lower layers is more significant for memorized sets.
- Contrastive objective involves increasing NLL of MPS and decreasing KL Divergence of NMPS.
- High gradient weights are more effective for unlearning than random weight masking.
- Activation gradients reveal the importance of head 2 in layer one for memorization.
- Rare tokens are crucial for memorization, as shown by attention head 2's focus.
- Future research could investigate making a model memorize non-memorized paragraphs.
- Activation patching and gradients are used to understand model memorization.
- The editing process involves finding alternative ways to express facts and adjusting the model.
