# SUMMARY
The text explores how the GPT Neo 125m model memorizes paragraphs, focusing on localization, perturbation, and unlearning of memorized information.

# IDEAS:
- GPT Neo 125m model trained on the Pile dataset to understand memorization.
- Memorized paragraph: sequence of 100 tokens where the model predicts next 50 tokens accurately.
- Perturbing individual tokens in memorized paragraphs is more challenging than non-memorized ones.
- Unlearning memorized information is easier than editing it.
- Attention head 2 in layer one focuses on rare tokens in the token distribution.
- Smaller models like GPT Neo 125m are easier to analyze at the level of individual weights.
- Exact match (M) and negative log likelihood (NLL) metrics used to identify memorized paragraphs.
- Memorized tokens are more ingrained in the model compared to non-memorized tokens.
- Larger gradients observed for non-memorized sets compared to memorized sets.
- Gradient flow in lower layers indicates smooth shift in gradient patterns for partly memorized paragraphs.
- Contrastive objective combines MPS and NMPS to adjust memorized continuations while keeping NMPS unchanged.
- High gradient weights are more effective for optimization than random weight masking.
- Activation gradients reveal importance of head 2 in layer one for memorization tasks.
- Rare tokens are crucial for memorization, as shown by attention head 2 in layer one.
- Future research could investigate making a model memorize a non-memorized paragraph.
- Activation patching and gradients used to understand model's internal mechanisms.
- Model editing involves finding alternative ways to express facts and adjusting the model accordingly.
- Memorization can improve performance or be beneficial for certain paragraph types.
- Systematic differences in how the model processes memorized and non-memorized sets.
- Analysis highlights challenges in removing MPS while preserving NMPS in Transformer models.
- Inner product of keys and queries calculated using softmax indicates attention from current token to previous tokens.
- Attention head 2 focuses on unique or rare tokens rather than common tokens like punctuation marks and stop words.
- Perturbing tokens and analyzing activations shows rare tokens' importance for memorization.
- Model parameters consist of layers and components like attention heads and MLP blocks.
- Differences in parameter gradients between memorized and non-memorized sets observed.
