# SUMMARY
The proposed Transformer FAM architecture, presented in a research paper, aims to efficiently handle long context tasks by introducing a feedback loop mechanism that enables working memory within Transformers.

# IDEAS:
- Transformer FAM introduces a feedback loop mechanism for handling long context tasks efficiently.
- The feedback loop enables the emergence of working memory within Transformers.
- Transformer FAM can process arbitrarily long sequences while preserving very long-term dependencies.
- It maintains past information for an indefinite horizon, making it suitable for large language models (LLMs).
- Feedback Attention Memory (FAM) is incorporated into block segments and self-attention processes.
- FAM compresses and retains important contextual information within extremely long contexts.
- The architecture optimizes latent space usage by offloading contextual data to FAM.
- It reduces duplication within input activations and enhances contextual representation efficiency.
- Transformer FAM complements Block Sliding Window Attention (BSWA) memory segments with FAM.
- This results in enhanced performance on long context tasks across different model sizes.
- The feedback loop is achieved by adding virtual activations called FAM to each block of BSWA.
- FAM serves several key functions: integrated attention, blockwise updates, information compression, and global contextual storage.
- During self-attention within a block, the input query attends to the input key for that block, the memory segment, and the previous FAM.
- The FAM query attends to the current block and the FAM key, compressing the current block based on previous global contextual information.
- The updated FAM then propagates this global contextual information to the next block recursively.
- This process allows for dynamic propagation of comprehensive contextual information across blocks.
- The architecture balances local representations stored in BSWA memory segments and global representations stored in FAM.
- Transformer FAM has a computational complexity of O(L) and a memory complexity of O(1) during inference.
- This is a substantial improvement over the quadratic memory and computation complexity of traditional Transformers.
- Transformer FAM does not introduce new weights, allowing for the reuse of pre-trained checkpoints.
- Fine-tuning Transformer FAM with LoRA significantly enhances performance on long context tasks.
- Experimental results show that Transformer FAM outperforms Transformer BSWA on long context tasks.
- Transformer FAM was validated by fine-tuning it with LoRA for 50k steps on long context tasks across various model sizes.
- The experiments compared Transformer FAM with Transformer BSWA on tasks such as NarQA, Scrolls, Casper, Scrolls Quality, and XLUM.
- Transformer FAM showed significant improvements over Transformer BSWA on all long context tasks.
- It effectively compressed and retained crucial contextual information within extremely long contexts.
- Transformer FAM marginally surpassed Transformer BSWA on GPT-3 tasks despite shorter contexts.
- The combination of BSWA memory segments for local representation and FAM for global representation proved complementary.
- Implementing feedback loops in Transformers is challenging due to the complexity of managing feedback connections.
- Feedback mechanisms can enhance the model's ability to retain past information for an indefinite horizon.
- There may be concerns about increased computational and memory requirements associated with feedback mechanisms.
- The effectiveness of feedback mechanisms in Transformers may vary depending on the specific task or dataset.
