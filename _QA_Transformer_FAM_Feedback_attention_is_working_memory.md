# SUMMARY
The proposed Transformer FAM architecture, presented in the context of long context tasks, introduces a feedback loop mechanism to efficiently handle long sequences and maintain long-term dependencies.

# IDEAS:
- Transformer FAM introduces a feedback loop mechanism for handling long context tasks efficiently.
- The feedback loop enables the emergence of working memory within Transformers.
- Transformer FAM can process arbitrarily long sequences while preserving very long-term dependencies.
- It maintains past information for an indefinite horizon, making it suitable for large language models.
- Feedback Attention Memory (FAM) is incorporated into block segments and self-attention processes.
- FAM compresses and retains important contextual information within extremely long contexts.
- The architecture optimizes latent space usage by offloading contextual data to FAM.
- It reduces duplication within input activations and enhances contextual representation efficiency.
- Transformer FAM complements Block Sliding Window Attention (BSWA) memory segments with FAM.
- The architecture results in enhanced performance on long context tasks across different model sizes.
- FAM serves several key functions: integrated attention, blockwise updates, information compression, and global contextual storage.
- During self-attention, the input query attends to the input key, memory segment, and previous FAM.
- The FAM query attends to the current block and the FAM key, compressing the current block based on previous global contextual information.
- The updated FAM propagates global contextual information to the next block recursively.
- This process allows dynamic propagation of comprehensive contextual information across blocks.
- The architecture balances local representations stored in BSW memory segments and global representations stored in FAM.
- Transformer FAM has a computational complexity of O(L) and a memory complexity of O(1) during inference.
- It allows for the reuse of pre-trained checkpoints, advantageous for fine-tuning and scalability.
- Experimental results show significant performance enhancement on long context tasks across various model sizes.
- Transformer FAM outperforms Transformer BSWA on long context tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- The architecture was validated by fine-tuning with LoRA for 50k steps on long context tasks.
- Performance was evaluated using memory segment sizes ranging from 0 to 8.
- Transformer FAM showed significant improvements over Transformer BSWA on all long context tasks.
- It effectively compressed and retained crucial contextual information within extremely long contexts.
- Transformer FAM marginally surpassed Transformer BSWA on GPT-3 tasks despite shorter contexts.
- The combination of BWA memory segments for local representation and FAM for global representation proved complementary.
- Implementing feedback loops within Transformers is challenging due to managing feedback connections.
- Feedback mechanisms can enhance the model's ability to retain past information for an indefinite horizon.
- There may be concerns about increased computational and memory requirements with feedback mechanisms.
- The effectiveness of feedback mechanisms may vary depending on the specific task or dataset.
