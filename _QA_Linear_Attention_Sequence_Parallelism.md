# SUMMARY
The Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP) technique addresses memory constraints in training large language models by partitioning input sequences and distributing them across multiple GPUs.

# IDEAS:
- LASP partitions input sequences into subsequence chunks distributed across multiple GPUs.
- Memory limitations of a single GPU restrict maximum sequence length of language models.
- LASP leverages right product kernel tricks in linear attention for efficiency.
- LASP's design is independent of attention heads partitioning, making it flexible.
- System engineering optimizations like kernel fusion and KV State caching enhance execution efficiency.
- LASP uses point-to-point communication for exchanging intermediate states during forward and backward passes.
- Data sequence hybrid parallelism integrates with data parallelism, reducing memory constraints.
- Intra chunks refer to independent attention computation within subsequence chunks.
- Inter chunks involve coordinated computation across different subsequence chunks.
- Kernel fusion streamlines computations and reduces overhead in LASP.
- KV State caching stores activation KV in high bandwidth memory, avoiding recomputation.
- Data sequence hybrid parallelism splits data along both batch and sequence dimensions.
- Traditional data parallelism splits data along the batch dimension only.
- LASP's communication mechanism optimizes information exchange for efficient linear attention computation.
- Linear attention with causal masking has computational complexity of O(nd^2).
- LASP achieves lower theoretical communication volume compared to Megatron LM and DeepSpeed.
- LASP enables scaling of sequence length up to 496k using the FSDP backend.
- LASP outperforms existing SP methods like DeepSpeed Ulses and Megatron in throughput.
- System optimizations in LASP support the longest sequence lengths within the same cluster.
- LASP does not negatively affect model convergence.
- Ablation experiments show LASP significantly reduces activation memory usage per GPU.
- LASP achieves linear scalability in sequence length with the number of GPUs used.
