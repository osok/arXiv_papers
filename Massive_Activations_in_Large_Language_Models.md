# SUMMARY
Researchers investigate the internal dynamics of large language models (LLMs), discovering rare but crucial "massive activations" that act as fixed biases, significantly influencing model performance and attention mechanisms.

# IDEAS:
- Massive activations in LLMs are more than four orders of magnitude larger than the median.
- These activations are rare, appearing fewer than 10 times among tens of millions of activations.
- Massive activations occur across various LLMs, regardless of size or family.
- They appear abruptly after a single layer of computation and diminish in final layers.
- Massive activations are not tied to specific inputs but occur in a small number of feature dimensions.
- Nullifying just four massive activations in Llama 2 to 7B led to a dramatic drop in model performance.
- Adjusting massive activations to their mean values did not adversely affect the model.
- Massive activations act as fixed but essential bias terms within the models.
- LLMs repurpose tokens associated with massive activations to store these crucial biases.
- There is a strong connection between massive activations and self-attention mechanisms.
- Massive activations draw attention to their associated tokens, extending the concept of attention sinks.
- LLMs attempt to learn implicit bias components and self-attention through massive activations during pre-training.
- Augmenting self-attention with additional key and value embeddings can eliminate the need for massive activations.
- Massive activations are also found in Vision Transformers (ViTs), acting as fixed biases.
- In ViTs, massive activations vary across patch tokens but are found at fixed feature dimensions.
- Massive activations in ViTs suggest an alternative interpretation of their function as fixed biases.
- Intense activations in LLMs tend to occur at the same spot across many middle layers.
- Intense activations appear suddenly rather than building up gradually.
- Intense activations are linked to the first word token and delimiter tokens in sequence dimensions.
- Intense activations are scalar values linked to specific tokens, distinct from outlier features.
- Outlier features are vectors affecting all tokens, while intense activations occur at far fewer tokens.
- Modifying massive activations significantly impacts model performance, highlighting their critical role.
- Attention logits turn slightly positive for tokens with massive activations, attracting attention probability.
- Introducing explicit attention biases can replace the need for LLMs to develop massive activations.
- Register tokens in ViTs serve a similar purpose to explicit biases in LLMs.

# INSIGHTS:
- Massive activations act as fixed biases, crucial for LLM performance and attention mechanisms.
- These activations appear abruptly and are not tied to specific inputs, indicating a unique mechanism.
- Nullifying massive activations drastically reduces model performance, underscoring their importance.
- Adjusting massive activations to mean values does not harm performance, showing they function as constants.
- LLMs use massive activations to store crucial biases, repurposing tokens for this function.
- Self-attention mechanisms are influenced by massive activations, drawing attention to associated tokens.
- Augmenting self-attention with explicit biases can eliminate the need for massive activations.
- Massive activations in ViTs act as fixed biases, similar to their role in LLMs.
- Intense activations are distinct from outlier features, occurring at specific tokens rather than across all tokens.
- Explicit attention biases can replace the need for LLMs to develop massive activations during pre-training.
