# SUMMARY
We investigate a surprising discovery in large language models (LLMs) where certain activations within the models exhibit significantly larger magnitudes, termed as massive activations. These massive activations, despite being rare and few in number, play a crucial role as fixed bias terms in LLMs, influencing model performance and attention mechanisms. We find that these massive activations are not unique to specific LLM models but are observed across various LLMs, showcasing their importance in understanding the internal mechanisms of these models.

# IDEAS:
- Massive activations in LLMs are more than four orders of magnitude larger than the median.
- These activations appear fewer than 10 times among tens of millions of activations.
- Massive activations occur across a wide variety of LLMs regardless of their size or family.
- They emerge abruptly after a single layer of computation and diminish in final layers.
- Massive activations are not tied to specific inputs but occur in a small number of feature dimensions.
- They act as fixed but essential bias terms within the models, similar to a linear layer equation.
- Nullifying just four massive activations led to a dramatic drop in model performance.
- Adjusting massive activations to their mean values did not adversely affect the model.
- LLMs repurpose tokens associated with massive activations to store these crucial biases.
- There is a strong connection between massive activations and self-attention mechanisms.
- Massive activations draw attention to their associated tokens, extending the concept of attention sinks.
- LLMs attempt to learn implicit bias components and self-attention through massive activations during pre-training.
- Augmenting self-attention with additional key and value embeddings can eliminate the need for massive activations.
- Massive activations are also found in Vision Transformers (ViTs), acting as fixed biases.
- In ViTs, massive activations vary across patch tokens but are found at fixed feature dimensions.
- Massive activations in ViTs suggest an alternative interpretation as fixed biases rather than aggregators of global image information.
- Intense activations tend to occur at the same spot across many middle layers of LLMs.
- Intense activations appear suddenly rather than building up gradually.
- Intense activations are linked to the first word token and delimiter tokens in sequence dimensions.
- Intense activations are scalar values linked to specific tokens, distinct from outlier features which are vectors affecting all tokens.
- Modifying massive activations significantly impacts model performance, highlighting their critical role.
- Attention logits turn slightly positive for tokens with massive activations, attracting majority attention probability.
- Introducing explicit attention biases can replace the need for LLMs to develop massive activations during pre-training.
- Massive activations help focus attention on specific tokens, acting as implicit bias terms.
- Register tokens in ViTs serve a similar purpose to explicit biases experimented with in LLMs.
