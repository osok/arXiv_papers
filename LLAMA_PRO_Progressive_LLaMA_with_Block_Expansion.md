# SUMMARY
The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing, but limitations in specific domains persist. The paper proposes a post-pre-training method called block expansion to enhance LLMs' capabilities without excessive computational resources. The extended model, Llama Pro, demonstrates improved performance in general and domain-specific tasks, particularly in programming, coding, and reasoning.
