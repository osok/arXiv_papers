# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the architecture of large language models (LLMs), focusing on efficient output retrieval using various algorithms and pre-processing steps.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs' outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional linear space.
- The softmax function maps contextualized embeddings to a five-dimensional subspace of the logit space.
- This design choice enables efficient computation and representation of the model's output distribution.
- An algorithm is introduced to recover full outputs from restricted APIs by incorporating a bias term.
- This algorithm reduces the number of API calls required to obtain complete output distributions.
- The approach achieves a more streamlined process for accessing comprehensive outputs from the LLM.
- A numerically stable algorithm addresses numerical instability issues in obtaining full outputs from APIs.
- This algorithm ensures reliable and accurate recovery of complete outputs from the API.
- A practical algorithm is tailored for handling stochastic APIs that randomly select outputs.
- This algorithm optimizes the collection of full outputs by requiring fewer API calls on average.
- The algorithm offers a more efficient solution for managing stochastic API behavior.
- A pre-processing step identifies the low-dimensional image of the LLM.
- This pre-processing step significantly reduces the number of API calls needed to obtain full outputs.
- The pre-processing step results in a substantial speed-up in obtaining complete LLM outputs.
- The process can be up to 100 times faster and more cost-effective depending on the specific LLM model used.
