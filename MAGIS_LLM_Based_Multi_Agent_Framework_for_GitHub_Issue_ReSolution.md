# SUMMARY
The text discusses the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in resolving GitHub issues under two settings: with and without Oracle. It highlights factors like line location and code complexity, introduces a multi-agent framework (Maus), and compares its performance with other LLMs.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs show better performance with Oracle but still have low success rates.
- Two factors affecting success: line location and code complexity.
- Code changes consist of multiple modified hunks specifying line numbers and details.
- Accurate line localization is crucial for resolving GitHub issues.
- Cloud 2 performs best in line localization, followed by GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- Higher complexity in code changes impedes issue resolution.
- Maus framework leverages collaboration among different agents for better performance.
- Four key agent roles: manager, repository custodian, developer, QA engineer.
- BM25 method used to find relevant code files in the without Oracle setting.
- Higher recall scores with fewer files optimize LLM performance.
- Maus framework outperforms other LLMs significantly in issue resolution.
- Human input enhances issue resolution in the Maus framework.
- Planning process involves locating code files, team building, and kickoff meetings.
- Repository custodian uses BM25 algorithm to rank files based on issue descriptions.
- Manager recruits team members and defines tasks using LLM.
- Developers generate QA engineer role descriptions using LLM.
- QA engineer reviews code changes for quality and provides feedback.
- Experiments validate Maus framework's performance using SWE Bench dataset.
- Maus framework achieves higher resolved ratios compared to GPT-4 and Claude 2.
- QA engineer's involvement significantly improves resolved ratios.
- Accurate line location aids in issue resolution.
- Complexity indices impact issue resolution rates.
- Maus framework handles complex code changes effectively.
- Framework adds more lines, especially comments, compared to human solutions.
- Unresolved instances involve more complex scenarios requiring further enhancement.
- Variability across repositories influences code change effectiveness.
- Prompt words influence LLM performance and fairness of outcomes.
- Data set limitations may affect framework's applicability to diverse code projects.
- LLM-based multi-agent systems tackle tasks beyond standalone LLM capabilities.

# INSIGHTS:
- Accurate line localization is crucial for resolving GitHub issues effectively.
- Higher complexity in code changes impedes the resolution process significantly.
- Collaboration among different agents enhances the performance of LLM frameworks.
- Human input, especially from QA engineers, significantly improves issue resolution rates.
- The balance between recall optimization and the number of selected files is vital for LLM performance.
- Planning processes involving role agents improve task clarity and collaboration.
- The Maus framework demonstrates superior performance in resolving complex issues compared to other LLMs.
- Prompt words and data set limitations can influence the fairness and applicability of LLM frameworks.
