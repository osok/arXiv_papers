# SUMMARY
The text discusses the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in resolving GitHub issues under two settings: with and without Oracle. It highlights factors like line location and code complexity, and introduces a multi-agent framework (Maus) to enhance issue resolution.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs show better performance with Oracle but still have low success rates.
- GP4 achieved only a 1.74% resolution rate on the SWE Bench dataset.
- Line location and code complexity are crucial for issue resolution.
- Code changes consist of multiple modified hunks specifying line numbers and details.
- Accurate line localization is essential for successful issue resolution.
- Cloud 2 outperforms GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in line localization accuracy.
- Higher overlap ratios between generated and reference code improve issue resolution.
- More complex code changes hinder issue resolution.
- Cloud 2 handles complex code changes more efficiently than other models.
- The BM25 method helps locate relevant code files in the without Oracle setting.
- Including more files can improve recall scores but strain LLMs.
- A balance between recall optimization and file selection is crucial.
- The Maus framework involves four key agent roles: manager, repository custodian, developer, and QA engineer.
- The manager decomposes issues into tasks and designs developer teams.
- The repository custodian locates relevant files efficiently.
- Developers generate code changes, while QA engineers review them for quality.
- The planning process includes locating code files, team building, and a kickoff meeting.
- The BM25 algorithm ranks files based on GitHub issue descriptions.
- Filtering irrelevant files optimizes subsequent code changes by LLMs.
- The manager recruits team members and defines tasks based on candidate files.
- Developers generate QA engineer role descriptions using LLMs.
- The iterative process continues until code changes meet quality standards.
- Experiments validate the framework's performance compared to other LLMs.
- The framework outperforms GP4 and Cloud 2 in resolved ratios.
- Human input enhances issue resolution in the framework.
- Accurate line location aids in issue resolution.
- The QA engineer significantly improves resolved ratios.
- The framework handles complex code changes similar to human-written solutions.
- Unresolved instances involve more complex scenarios requiring further enhancement.
- The framework outperforms Devon in resolving shared issues within a shorter time frame.
- Prompt word choice influences LLM performance and fairness of outcomes.
- The dataset used may not fully capture the diversity of all code projects on GitHub.

# INSIGHTS:
- Accurate line localization is crucial for successful GitHub issue resolution.
- Complex code changes hinder issue resolution, requiring efficient handling by LLMs.
- Human input, especially from QA engineers, significantly enhances issue resolution.
- Balancing recall optimization and file selection is vital for LLM performance without Oracle.
- The Maus framework's multi-agent approach improves GitHub issue resolution efficiency.
