- GPT-4 outperforms Gemini and open-source models in text and coding tasks.
- Gemini shows superior multilingual capabilities but falls short in mathematical reasoning and domain knowledge.
- GPT-4 demonstrates better grasp and application of specialized knowledge.
- Gemini Pro struggles with trustworthiness and safety in text and code compared to GPT-4.
- Models show varying degrees of capability in understanding and generating image-related content.
- Video content processing presents challenges, with open-source MLLMs tuned on video data performing better.
- GPT-4 stands out for its ethical sensitivity and safety protocols.
- The study highlights areas for improvement in MLLMs, particularly in generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning.
- Enhancing these areas can help realize the full potential of MLLMs in practical applications.
- Simple and fair prompts were used across all models to ensure a level playing field.
- Quantitative metrics were adopted to score the models based on average rankings across tests.
- The study aims to guide towards more reliable multimodal applications.
