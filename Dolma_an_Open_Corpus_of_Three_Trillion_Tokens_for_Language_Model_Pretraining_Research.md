# SUMMARY
The authors present Dolma, a 3-trillion-token dataset for training language models, emphasizing openness and transparency to enhance research and development in natural language processing.

# IDEAS:
- Language models are crucial for tasks like summarizing, question answering, and few-shot learning.
- Big players often don't share details about how they build language models.
- Lack of transparency in training data hinders understanding of model capabilities and limitations.
- Openness in data helps developers and users make better decisions.
- Dolma is a 3-trillion-token dataset from diverse sources like web pages, scientific papers, and social media.
- Dolma aims to support research into training language models.
- The dataset includes tools for managing large datasets, enabling reproducibility.
- Dolma has already been used to train state-of-the-art models called MMO.
- The dataset is designed to be large, high-quality, and diverse.
- Dolma supports research into issues like data memorization, handling duplicates, and resisting hacking attempts.
- The dataset helps trace model outputs back to the training data.
- Dolma aligns with well-established practices for choosing and preparing data.
- The dataset sticks to English to ensure wide applicability.
- Dolma provides a detailed look at proprietary and open language models like GPT-4 and LLaMA.
- The dataset aims to reduce risks by matching how other language modeling datasets are created.
- Dolma should play a significant role in training large models.
- There should be a balanced ratio between model size and training data.
- Existing datasets like C4, Pile, and Falcon have limitations.
- Dolma aims to be the largest curated open pre-training corpus to date.
- Openness includes sharing the data itself and documenting the curation process.
- The dataset minimizes risks by consulting legal and ethics experts.
- Dolma masks personal identifiable information to mitigate risks.
- The dataset provides tools for requesting data removal.
- Dolma's evaluation suite guides decisions during pre-training.
- The dataset prioritizes decisions that align with research directions of interest to academic or nonprofit institutions.
