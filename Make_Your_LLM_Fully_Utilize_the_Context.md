# SUMMARY
The text discusses the construction of a dataset for IN2 training and the detailed training process of the FILM 7B model, focusing on teaching the model to recognize essential information within long contexts.

# IDEAS:
- IN2 training aims to teach models that any position in a long context can contain crucial information.
- Training data D is created using a general natural language corpus C.
- Questions and answers are generated with the help of a powerful LLM.
- Long contexts are synthesized from raw texts and other randomly selected texts.
- Two types of question-answer pairs are created: detailed information and integrating reasoning.
- Real news-like subset from the C4 corpus is used as C.
- GP4 Turbo is employed as the LLM to generate QA pairs.
- Fine-grained information awareness considers 128-token segments as the smallest unit.
- Randomly selected 128-token segments are used to create question-answer pairs.
- Multi-hop question-answer pairs involve information from at least two segments.
- Long contexts are evenly distributed from 4K to 32K tokens to ensure fair training.
- About 10% of question-answer pairs are kept with original texts to prevent forgetting.
- The dataset includes 1.1 million long context data for fine-grained information awareness.
- Training involves a global batch size of 128, one epoch, and cosine learning rate decay.
- Training is conducted on 16 nodes of 8X 80 GA 100 GPUs, taking about 300 GPU days.
- Val probing involves three context styles: document, code, and structured data context.
- Three retrieval patterns in Val probing: forward, backward, and bidirectional retrieval.
- Film 7B addresses the "lost in the middle" problem effectively.
- Film 7B achieves comparable or better performance than GP4 Turbo on probing tasks.
- Val probing presents a more challenging test suite for long context models.
- LongAlign and Intern LM2 models face challenges in Val probing despite larger training windows.
- Training on artificially created long context data translates effectively to real-world scenarios.
- Film 7B maintains performance on short context tasks.
- Sliding window strategy hampers long context capability during training.
- Adjusting ROPE settings can enhance IN2 training performance.
- Recent research focuses on data engineering and effective training methods for long context LLMs.

# INSIGHTS:
- IN2 training teaches models that crucial information can be anywhere in a long context.

- Fine-grained information awareness uses 128-token segments as the minimum unit.
- Multi-hop question-answer pairs improve reasoning across multiple segments.
- Even distribution of long contexts ensures fair training without bias towards length.
- Keeping some original short context pairs prevents catastrophic forgetting in models.
- Val probing tests models with document, code, and structured data contexts.
- Film 7B effectively addresses the "lost in the middle" problem in long contexts.
- Artificially created long context data generalizes well to real-world tasks.
- Sliding window strategy significantly hampers long context capability during training.
