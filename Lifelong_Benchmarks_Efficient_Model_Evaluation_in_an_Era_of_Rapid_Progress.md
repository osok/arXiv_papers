# SUMMARY
The text discusses the limitations of current machine learning benchmarks and proposes lifelong benchmarks to better evaluate model performance on real-world data. It introduces lifelong CIFAR-10 and lifelong ImageNet benchmarks and the Sort and Search (SNS) method to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

# IDEAS:
- Lifelong benchmarks aim to evaluate models on data representing the real world.

- Evaluating large-scale models is costly in terms of computation resources.
- Sort and Search (SNS) method dynamically selects test samples based on difficulty.
- SNS reduces computational costs by over 99.9% while maintaining accuracy.
- Lifelong benchmarks involve inserting new labeled examples and models over time.
- Prediction cache stores outcomes of model evaluations to save computation time.
- Efficient evaluation involves selecting a small subset of models or examples.
- Lifelong benchmarking has not been widely explored but is crucial for scalable evaluation.
- SNS framework ranks test samples from easiest to hardest for efficient evaluation.
- Optimizing the ranking problem involves finding the best permutation matrix.
- Dynamic programming reduces time complexity from quadratic to linear.
- Efficient selection by search helps in evaluating new models with fewer samples.
- Power law relationship observed between prediction error and sampling budget.
- High sample efficiency achieved by SNS method in predicting model performance.
- Recursive sorting by sum improves performance by correcting local ranking errors.
- Uniform sampling outperforms random sampling, especially with small budgets.
- Errors in sort and search can be broken down into aleatoric and epistemic errors.
- Aleatoric error arises from inherent uncertainty in data and sorting operation.
- Epistemic error can be minimized by increasing the sample size.
- Future research could explore multi-step continual ranking and evaluation.
