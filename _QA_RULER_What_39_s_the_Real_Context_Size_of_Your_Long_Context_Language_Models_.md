# SUMMARY
The Ruler Benchmark evaluates long context modeling capabilities in language models, focusing on tasks like multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.

# IDEAS:
- Ruler Benchmark evaluates long context modeling capabilities for language models comprehensively.
- Developed to go beyond simple retrieval tasks used in previous works.
- Assesses behaviors like multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.
- Offers flexibility in controlling sequence length and task complexity.
- Reduces reliance on parametric knowledge interfering with long context input.
- Provides a standardized platform for assessing and comparing model performance.
- Introduces new task categories beyond simple retrieval from long context.
- Tests behaviors like co-reference chain resolution, summarization, and question answering.
- Evaluates models based on retrieval capability agnostic to needle and haystack type.
- Measures strength in disregarding hard distractors and high recall for multiple items.
- Uses synthetic tasks to control sequence length and task complexity.
- Criteria for tasks include retrieval capability, disregarding hard distractors, and high recall.
- Variable tracking task emulates minimal co-reference chain resolution.
- Evaluates model's ability to track relevant co-occurrence patterns and draw skipped connections.
- Common words extraction and frequent words extraction tasks are proxies for summarization.
- CWE task requires returning top K common words in the context.
- FWE task requires returning top K frequent words in the context.
- Adding distinguishing information to QA datasets evaluates question answering at various context sizes.
- Models evaluated using B float 16 on 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs with greedy decoding.
- Evaluation includes 10 long context language models covering diverse sizes and architectures.
- Effective context size determined by performance threshold based on Llama 2 7B model.
- Models ranked using weighted average scores with two weighting schemes: wavg Inc and wavg deck.
- E34 B200K model exhibited non-robustness to different needle items and struggled with distractors.
