# SUMMARY
The Ruler Benchmark evaluates long context modeling capabilities of language models, focusing on tasks like multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.

# IDEAS:
- Ruler Benchmark evaluates long context modeling capabilities for language models in a comprehensive manner.
- It goes beyond simple retrieval tasks to assess behaviors like multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.
- Ruler consists of synthetic tasks offering flexibility in controlling sequence length and task complexity.
- The aim is to provide a standardized platform for assessing and comparing models' performance across different complexities.
- Ruler introduces new task categories that go beyond simple retrieval from long context.
- Tasks include multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering, testing behaviors like co-reference chain resolution.
- Ruler evaluates models based on criteria like the ability to retrieve information agnostic to the type of needle and haystack.
- Strength in disregarding hard distractors and high recall when multiple items need to be retrieved are key evaluation criteria.
- Existing benchmarks primarily focus on retrieval-based synthetic tasks and do not cover a wide range of long context understanding behaviors.
- Synthetic tasks in Ruler offer flexibility in controlling sequence length and task complexity.
- The four Nea tasks in Ruler are developed based on three key aspects to evaluate models' retrieval capability comprehensively.
- Retrieval capability should be agnostic to the type of needle and haystack.
- Models should demonstrate strength in disregarding hard distractors.
- Models should exhibit high recall when multiple items need to be retrieved.
- The variable tracking VT task emulates a minimal co-reference chain resolution task.
- The VT task evaluates the model's ability to recognize newly mentioned entities and establish chains of references.
- Common words extraction (CWE) and frequent words extraction (FWE) tasks are designed as proxy tasks for summarization.
- CWE task requires the model to return the top K common words in the context.
- FWE task requires the model to return the top K frequent words in the context.
- Adding distinguishing information to short context QA datasets allows for evaluating question answering capability at various context sizes.
- Models are evaluated using B float 16 on 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs with greedy decoding for all models.
- Evaluation includes 10 long context language models (LLMs) covering diverse model sizes and claimed contact lengths.
- Models are tested on 13 tasks ranging in diverse complexities from the four categories of Ruler.
- Effective context size is determined by comparing performance against a fixed threshold based on Llama 2 7B model at 4K context length.
- Models are ranked using weighted average scores by aggregating performance across various context sizes.
- Two weighting schemes are employed: wavg Inc (increasing weight with sequence length) and wavg deck (decreasing weight with sequence length).
- Top models consistently outperform others regardless of the chosen weighting scheme.
- E34 B200K model exhibited non-robustness to different types of needle items, leading to incomplete answers with longer input contexts.
- E34 B200K struggled to ignore distractors effectively, resulting in incorrect retrievals with increased distracting items.
- E34 B200K showed unreliable tracking within the context, struggling with tasks requiring tracing the same entity across long sequences.
