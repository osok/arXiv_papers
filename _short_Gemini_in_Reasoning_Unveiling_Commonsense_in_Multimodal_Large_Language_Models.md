# SUMMARY
The paper discusses developing models to recognize common knowledge, interpret contexts, understand causality, and apply scientific principles in daily life.

# IDEAS:
- Models should comprehend that birds typically fly and fish live in water.
- Success is gauged by the model's ability to recognize and understand basic knowledge.
- Models should interpret contextual information, like a shivering person likely being cold.
- Models should generate plausible explanations for observations, such as wet streets due to rain.
- Understanding sequences of events and causal relationships is crucial for model development.
- Predicting that eating spoiled food can lead to feeling sick is an example of causal understanding.
- Models should understand time-related concepts, like breakfast being eaten in the morning.
- Understanding numbers in everyday contexts, such as a cube having six faces, is important.
- Models should reason about physical properties, like a glass breaking if dropped on a hard floor.
- Applying scientific principles in daily life is a key goal for model development.
- Understanding social interactions and evaluating actions based on moral standards is essential.
- Interpreting visual information in physical and social contexts is a significant achievement.
- Recognizing that water boils at a higher temperature at sea level than in the mountains is important.
- Understanding that a crying person is likely upset is a key social interaction insight.
- Knowing that stealing is generally considered wrong is a moral and ethical standard.
- Deducing that a person in a photo wearing a number bib is likely running a race is crucial.
- The model's ability to apply, understand, evaluate, and interpret these concepts is vital.
- Developing models that can accurately understand and predict causal relationships is significant.
- Enabling models to understand physical world interactions will be a major achievement.
- Models should be able to interpret information within specific contexts accurately.
