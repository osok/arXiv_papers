# SUMMARY
The proposed method addresses passive exploration in online alignment frameworks for language models, introducing active exploration to avoid overfitting and premature convergence.

# IDEAS:
- Passive exploration in online alignment frameworks leads to overfitting and premature convergence.
- Responses cluster around local optima, leaving high-reward regions unexplored.
- Active exploration approach elicits novel favorable responses through an optimism term.
- Optimism term added to the reward fitting objective ensures effective out-of-distribution exploration.
- Balances between exploring novel responses and exploiting previously observed ones.
- Iteratively updates the LLM without a separate reward model.
- Optimism term encourages exploration of high-potential unknown regions.
- Bi-level objective includes minimizing logistic regression loss and maximizing expected reward.
- Reparameterizing the reward function with policy parameters balances exploration and exploitation.
- Actively generates out-of-distribution responses worth exploring.
- Uses AI rankers to provide feedback on model-generated responses.
- Mitigates indiscriminate favoring of unseen extrapolations.
- Enhances exploration efficiency by reducing low-reward responses.
- Achieves higher win rates and scores compared to iterative DPO baselines.
- Demonstrates robustness and consistent performance improvements in each iteration.
- Can be integrated into various online alignment frameworks with or without a separate reward model.
- Validated through experiments on benchmarks like Alpaca Val 2.0, MT Bench, and others.
- Shows significant performance improvements on instruction-following chat benchmarks.
- Outperforms iterative DPO on various benchmarks.
- Evaluated in zero-shot, few-shot, and few-shot chain-of-thought settings.
