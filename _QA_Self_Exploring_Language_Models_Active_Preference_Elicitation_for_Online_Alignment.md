# SUMMARY
The proposed method addresses passive exploration in online alignment frameworks for language models by introducing an active exploration approach, enhancing model accuracy and alignment.

# IDEAS:
- Passive exploration in online alignment frameworks leads to overfitting and premature convergence.
- Standard methods cluster responses around local optima, leaving high-reward regions unexplored.
- The method introduces an optimism term to the reward fitting objective for active exploration.
- Active exploration elicits novel favorable responses, ensuring effective out-of-distribution exploration.
- The method balances exploring novel responses and exploiting previously observed ones.
- The algorithm iteratively updates the LLM without a separate reward model.
- Optimism term encourages LLM to explore high-potential unknown regions.
- The algorithm optimizes a bi-level objective, minimizing logistic regression loss and maximizing expected reward.
- Reparameterizing the reward function with policy parameters ensures balanced exploration and exploitation.
- AI rankers provide feedback on model-generated and original responses.
- Guided exploration mitigates indiscriminate favoring of unseen extrapolations.
- The method enhances exploration efficiency by reducing low-reward responses.
- SELM achieves higher win rates and scores on instruction-following chat benchmarks.
- SELM demonstrates robustness and consistent performance improvements in each iteration.
- SELM can be integrated into various online alignment frameworks with or without a separate reward model.
- Experiments validate SELM's effectiveness on benchmarks like Alpaca Val 2.0, MT Bench, and others.
- SELM outperforms iterative DPO on various benchmarks, showcasing its superiority.
- SELM is evaluated in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought settings on multiple-choice QA benchmarks.
- SELM balances exploration and exploitation, leading to a more accurate and aligned model.
- Performance improvements are more significant with stronger base models like LLaMA 3 to 8B Instruct.
- The method requires careful dataset partitioning and update rules, introducing complexity.
- Effectiveness relies on the quality and diversity of training data, which may be challenging to curate.
- Performance may degrade after the RHF phase on some benchmarks, known as the alignment tax.
