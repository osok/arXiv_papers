# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (Iterative RPO) to enhance language models' reasoning abilities, particularly in Chain of Thought (CoT) tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Iterative RPO aims to improve reasoning ability in language models, focusing on Chain of Thought tasks.
- The method generates multiple CoT reasoning steps and final answers for training prompts.
- Preference pairs are constructed where winners have correct answers and losers have wrong answers.
- A variant of DPO with a negative log likelihood (NLL) loss term is used for pair winners.
- The iterative process updates the model with new preference data until performance saturates.
- Iterative RPO outperforms baselines like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and standard DPO.
- The method involves two main steps: CoT and answer generation, and preference optimization.
- In CoT and answer generation, the model generates multiple responses for each input.
- Responses are evaluated based on the correctness of their final answers compared to gold labels.
- Preference pairs are used to train a new model by combining DPO loss and NLL loss.
- The iterative process continues with each new model trained using preference data from the previous model.
- The method shows significant improvements in reasoning ability across tasks like GSM 8K, Arc Challenge, and math.
- Iterative RPO leverages iterative preference optimization to train generative reasoning models.
- The approach allows for effective model training by incorporating an NLL loss term for pair winners.
- Continuous reasoning performance improvements are achieved until saturation is reached.
- The method provides a simple yet powerful recipe for improving reasoning ability in LLMs.
- Results were achieved by iteratively applying preference optimization to reasoning tasks.
- The correctness of final answers is compared to gold labels to derive rewards.
- A dataset of response pairs is constructed based on generated responses with higher and lower rewards.
- A new model is trained using a loss function combining DPO loss and NLL loss for winning responses.
- Performance gains may decay across iterations, indicating an upper limit on learning.
- The method requires a significant amount of training data, which may decrease in later iterations.
- Reliance on preference optimization using DPO may not always lead to significant improvements.
- Future work could explore combining iterative reinforcement learning from human feedback with preference optimization.
- Investigating human-in-the-loop feedback to provide additional labels for retraining the reward model is suggested.
- Exploring novel iterative alignment methods that do not require human intervention is proposed.

# INSIGHTS:
- Iterative RPO enhances language models' reasoning abilities through iterative preference optimization.
- Constructing preference pairs with correct and incorrect answers facilitates effective model training.
- Combining DPO loss and NLL loss for winning responses improves reasoning performance iteratively.
- Continuous performance improvements are achieved until saturation, outperforming baselines like SFT and standard DPO.
- The method's reliance on fixed prompts may limit exploration of a wider range of inputs.
- Correctness of final answers in training data can introduce noise, especially in limited answer choice tasks.
- Performance gains may decay across iterations, indicating an upper limit on learning potential.
- Significant training data is required, which may decrease in later iterations due to lack of incorrect samples.
- Future work suggests integrating human feedback to enhance iterative training techniques further.
