# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (Iterative RPO) to enhance language models' reasoning abilities, particularly in Chain of Thought (CoT) tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Iterative RPO aims to improve reasoning ability in language models, especially in Chain of Thought tasks.
- The method generates multiple CoT reasoning steps and final answers for training prompts.
- Preference pairs are constructed where winners have correct answers and losers have wrong answers.
- A variant of DPO with a negative log likelihood (NLL) loss term is used for pair winners.
- The iterative process updates the model with new preference data until performance saturates.
- Iterative RPO outperforms baselines like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and standard DPO.
- The method involves two main steps: CoT and answer generation, and preference optimization.
- The current model generates multiple responses for each input, evaluated against gold labels.
- Generated responses are used to construct preference pairs for training a new model.
- The loss function combines DPO loss and NLL loss for learning over winning responses.
- Continuous reasoning performance improvements are achieved over multiple iterations.
- The method showcases significant improvements in tasks like GSM 8K, Arc Challenge, and math.
- Iterative RPO leverages iterative preference optimization to train generative reasoning models.
- The approach allows effective model training by incorporating an NLL loss term for pair winners.
- New pairs are generated, and the model is trained again from the previously trained model.
- The method provides a simple yet powerful recipe for improving reasoning ability in LLMs.
- Results were achieved by iteratively applying preference optimization to reasoning tasks.
- The correctness of final answers is compared to gold labels to derive rewards.
- A dataset of response pairs is constructed based on generated responses.
- A new model is trained using a loss function combining DPO loss and NLL loss.
- Performance gains may decay across iterations, indicating an upper limit on learning.
- The method requires a significant amount of training data, especially in later iterations.
- Reliance on preference optimization using DPO may not always lead to significant improvements.
- Future work could explore combining iterative reinforcement learning from human feedback with preference optimization.
- Investigating human-in-the-loop feedback to provide additional labels for retraining the reward model is suggested.
- Exploring novel iterative alignment methods that do not require human intervention is proposed.
