# SUMMARY
The section discusses building a library of skills using RNN states for retrieval and blending, leveraging a pre-trained Mamba model.

# IDEAS:
- Building a library of skills learned in context represented by RNN states for retrieval and blending.
- Utilizing straightforward tasks proposed by a previous study to generate skills for the library.
- Leveraging a pre-trained Mamba model with 2.8 billion parameters to generate these skills.
- Each state representing a skill is derived by processing 32 examples for each task.
- Gathering multiple sets of examples results in multiple RNN states for each skill.
- Aim to address three main questions: retrieval, blending, and sequential data application.
- Analyzing the intermediate layer from each state in the skill library and projecting it to two dimensions.
- Clear clustering where states related to the same task are grouped together.
- Tasks that the Mamba model struggles to learn are still clustered together.
- Quantitatively assessing the model's retrieval capabilities using query vectors.
- Approach can reliably identify the correct task even with one or two examples.
- Enhancing model's few-shot performance using the task library to blend states.
- Mixing strategy involves calculating the mean over states obtained from multiple examples.
- Mixing states can lead to improved performance, especially with mixtures from different tasks.
- Preliminary tests by blending states from distinct tasks show intriguing outcomes.
- Mixing sequential data requires considering the order of data processing.
- Developed a mixing strategy that considers the sequential nature of the data.
- Representing a single layer processing a sequence recursively as a function of previous elements.
- Breaking down the function into smaller parts to process subsequences independently.
- Combining subsequences using a computed matrix crucial for training different architectures.
- Named this approach Decay mixing, achieving similar results as processing entire sequences at once.
- In complex architectures, Decay mixing introduces approximation evident in stacked layers.
- Experiments showed Decay mixing outperformed mean mixing but fell short compared to entire sequence processing.
