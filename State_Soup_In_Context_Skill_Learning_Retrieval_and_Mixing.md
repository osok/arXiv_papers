# SUMMARY
The section discusses building a library of skills using RNN states for retrieval and blending, leveraging a pre-trained Mamba model with 2.8 billion parameters.

# IDEAS:
- Building a library of skills learned in context represented by RNN states.
- Utilizing straightforward tasks proposed by a previous study for skill generation.
- Leveraging a pre-trained Mamba model with 2.8 billion parameters.
- Each state representing a skill is derived by processing 32 examples per task.
- Gathering multiple sets of examples results in multiple RNN states for each skill.
- Addressing three main questions: retrieval, blending, and sequential data application.
- Analyzing intermediate layers from each state in the skill library.
- Projecting intermediate layers to two dimensions using t-SNE.
- Clear clustering where states related to the same task are grouped together.
- Tasks that the Mamba model struggles to learn are still clustered together.
- Quantitatively assessing the model's retrieval capabilities with few examples.
- Reliable identification of the correct task even with one or two examples.
- Enhancing model's few-shot performance using the task library to blend states.
- Calculating the mean over states for blending.
- Comparing standard in-context learning with state mixing.
- Mixing states can lead to improved performance, especially from different tasks.
- Preliminary tests by blending states from distinct tasks show intriguing outcomes.
- Mixing sequential data where the order of mixing matters.
- Developing a mixing strategy considering the sequential nature of data.
- Representing a single layer processing a sequence recursively as a function.
- Breaking down the function into smaller parts for independent processing.
- Combining subsequences using a computed matrix for efficient training.
- Naming this approach Decay Mixing.
- Achieving similar results as processing the entire sequence at once with Decay Mixing.
- Approximation introduced by Decay Mixing becomes evident in complex architectures.
- Experiments on datasets dividing sequences into chunks for comparison.
- Decay Mixing outperformed mean mixing and partial sequence processing.
- Decay Mixing fell short compared to processing the entire sequence.
