# SUMMARY
Deep generative models like diffusion and Poisson flow generative models use neural networks to predict vector fields for differential equations. A new sampling algorithm called Restart combines ODE and SDE advantages, improving sample quality and speed.

# IDEAS:

- Diffusion models and Poisson flow generative models are prominent in high-dimensional data modeling.
- ODE Samplers are deterministic after initial randomization, while SDE Samplers are stochastic.
- ODE Samplers make fewer discretization errors, allowing for decent sample quality with larger steps.
- SDE Samplers deliver better quality with more time but require extended sampling time.
- Restart algorithm combines ODE and SDE benefits by alternating forward and backward processes.
- Restart reduces accumulated errors effectively while minimizing discretization errors.

- Restart can perform tasks with 10 times fewer steps than the best SDEs, achieving the same quality.
- Restart further improves performance when applied to high-performing pre-trained models.
- Diffusion models use a forward process called the diffusion process, involving a noise schedule.
- The backward process in diffusion models reverses the forward process using SDE or ODE.
- Poisson flow generative models interpret data as electric charges, simulating differential equations.
- ODE Samplers perform better in the small NFE regime due to lower discretization error.
- SDE Samplers excel in the high NFE regime due to the contraction effect of stochasticity.
- Restart algorithm introduces substantial noise during sampling, enhancing contraction effects.
- Restart separates randomness from ODE, increasing contraction effect and reducing errors.
- Restart algorithm can reduce total sampling errors even with a small number of function evaluations.
- Restart algorithm allows for customization of time intervals and number of iterations.
- Multi-level restart method can further reduce simulation errors for complex tasks.
- Restart algorithm achieves lower contracted error and smaller total error compared to ODE and SDE methods.
- Restart outperforms other samplers in terms of sample quality and speed across different datasets.
- Restart achieves new best FID scores for certain architectures without additional training.
- Restart balances diversity against text-image alignment and visual quality more effectively than previous samplers.
