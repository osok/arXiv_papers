- Fine-tuning short LLMs for longer contexts is possible but comes with high costs.
- Continuous training to extend context may affect overall performance on shorter contexts.
- Most tasks needing long contexts can be solved by working with shorter contexts.
- Tasks like reading comprehension or summarization can be accomplished by extracting key information.
