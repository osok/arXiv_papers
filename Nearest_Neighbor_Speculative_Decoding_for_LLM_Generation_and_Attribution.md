# SUMMARY
The text discusses challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) and how retrieval augmentation, particularly Nea Neighbor Speculative Decoding (Nest), can improve their performance by reducing hallucinations and enhancing content generation.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs often struggle with hallucination, especially with less common knowledge.
- Retrieval augmentation combines information retrieval and nearest neighbor search to enhance LLM reasoning.
- Nea Neighbor Speculative Decoding (Nest) improves content generation by dynamically selecting text spans.
- Nest adapts the LLM's output based on token retrieval results.
- Retrieval augmentation can slow down the generation process due to retrieval time.
- Nest builds upon the 10-number10 NNLM method by incorporating real-world text spans.
- Nest includes a passage retrieval step to improve search efficiency.
- Nest operates in three main steps: conance-based interpolation, dynamic span selection, and relaxed speculative decoding.
- Conance-based interpolation adjusts the LLM's output based on token retrieval uncertainty.
- Dynamic span selection extends to a span in the corpus when retrieval confidence is high.
- Relaxed speculative decoding evaluates selected spans based on probability mixture.
- Nest outperforms base LLMs and standard 10-number1 NNLM in various tasks.
- Nest significantly speeds up long-form generation without sacrificing quality.
- Probability interpolation uses the hidden state as a query to retrieve nearest neighbors.
- A two-stage design for efficient token search balances latency and accuracy.
- Confidence-based output interpolation combines the LLM's distribution and a non-parametric distribution.
- Dynamic span selection maintains coherence in the generated output.
- Relaxed speculative decoding allows for more flexibility in the generation process.
- Experiments assess Nest and baseline models across tasks like text completion and question answering.
- Llama 2 chat is used in a zero-shot setting to mimic real-world model usage.
- Metrics like perplexity, Rouge, and Mauve are used for evaluation.
- Nest performs better for smaller models like 7B and 13B in question answering tasks.
- Retrieval methods are more beneficial for smaller models than larger ones like 70B.
- Nest offers better attribution and latency compared to baselines.
- Dynamic span selection and relaxed speculative decoding improve latency in LLM generation.
- Span-level attribution ensures accurate references directly from the corpus.
- Retrieval augmentation involves using external knowledge sources to enhance LLM performance.
- DQA combines extractive methods and independent retrievers for answering questions.
- Input augmentation methods add retrieved passages at the beginning of prompts.
- Intermediate fusion uses unique attention mechanisms to include multiple pre-processed text fragments.
- Output integration blends the retrieval distribution with the LLM's prediction.
- Revision speculative decoding generates drafts quickly for a larger model to evaluate.
