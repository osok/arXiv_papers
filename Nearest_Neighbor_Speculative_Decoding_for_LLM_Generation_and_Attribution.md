# SUMMARY
The text discusses challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) and how retrieval augmentation can improve their performance, particularly through the Nea Neighbor Speculative Decoding (Nest) approach.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs often struggle with hallucination, especially when dealing with less common knowledge.
- Retrieval augmentation combines information retrieval and nearest neighbor search to enhance LLMs' reasoning.
- Nea Neighbor Speculative Decoding (Nest) improves content generation by dynamically selecting text spans.
- Nest adapts the LLM's output based on token retrieval results, enhancing performance in various tasks.
- Nest includes a passage retrieval step at the beginning to improve search efficiency.
- Conance-based interpolation adjusts the LLM's output based on token retrieval uncertainty.
- Dynamic span selection extends to a span in the corpus when retrieval confidence is high.
- Relaxed speculative decoding evaluates selected spans based on probability mixture, accepting only highly likely prefixes.
- Nest outperforms base LLMs and standard methods in tasks like question answering and text completion.
- Probability interpolation uses the hidden state as a query to search a data store for nearest neighbors.
- A two-stage design for efficient token search balances latency and accuracy.
- Confidence-based output interpolation combines the LLM's distribution and a non-parametric distribution using a coefficient.
- Dynamic span selection maintains coherence in the generated output using a max pooling strategy.
- Relaxed speculative decoding adaptively controls the length of generated spans.
- Experiments assess Nest and baseline models across tasks like text completion, question answering, and fact verification.
- Llama 2 chat is used in a zero-shot setting to mimic real-world model usage.
- Metrics like perplexity, Rouge, and Mauve are used to evaluate performance.
- Nest performs better for smaller models in question answering tasks.
- Retrieval methods are more beneficial for smaller models than larger ones.
- Nest offers better attribution and latency compared to baseline models.
- Dynamic span selection and relaxed speculative decoding improve latency in LLM generation.
- Span-level attribution ensures accurate references directly from the corpus.
- Retrieval augmentation involves using external knowledge sources to enhance LLM performance.
- Input augmentation methods add retrieved passages at the beginning of prompts for factual support.
- Intermediate fusion methods include multiple pre-processed text fragments in intermediate layers.
- Output integration methods blend the retrieval distribution with the LLM's prediction.
- Revision speculative decoding uses a small model to generate drafts quickly for a larger model to evaluate.
