# SUMMARY
The study investigates task contamination in few-shot learning with large language models, revealing significant contamination and its impact on model performance.

# IDEAS:
- Few-shot methods, especially in-context learning (ICL), deliver impressive results with minimal data.
- Data contamination occurs when a model has prior knowledge of unseen data or tasks.
- Closed models don't disclose their pre-training data, making contamination assessment challenging.
- Open models' data can be difficult to obtain due to changes since collection.
- Task contamination undermines zero or few-shot evaluation reliability.
- The study evaluates 12 models on 16 classification tasks and one semantic parsing task.
- Models trained on pre-collection data sets perform better than those on post-collection data sets.
- Task contamination is more evident in proprietary models like the GPT-3 series.
- Four methods used to measure task contamination: training data inspection, task example extraction, membership inference, and chronological analysis.
- Chronological analysis has high recall but low precision for detecting task contamination.
- Training data inspection and task example extraction are precise but have low recall.
- Membership inference attack shows a strong correlation between extracted examples and model accuracy.
- GPT-3 series models show increased task contamination from Da Vinci to GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Performance increase in zero-shot settings is often due to task contamination.
- Open models rarely generate task-specific training examples, unlike GPT-3 series models.
- Instruction fine-tuning does not fully explain the performance increase in GPT-3 series.
- Task contamination detection is challenging due to data formatting variations and keyword differences.
- Publicly releasing training data sets can help diagnose contamination issues.
- Contaminated data sets often outperform uncontaminated ones, contradicting initial assumptions.
- Potential leaks of private data and copyrighted materials raise concerns about data contamination.
- Strategies for mitigating testing data contamination have been proposed but not for zero or few-shot settings.

# INSIGHTS:
- Task contamination significantly impacts the reliability of zero or few-shot evaluations.
- Proprietary models like GPT-3 series show higher task contamination than open models.
- Chronological analysis is effective for detecting task contamination but lacks precision.
- Training data inspection and task example extraction are precise but miss many contamination cases.
- Membership inference attack reveals a strong link between extracted examples and model accuracy.
- Publicly releasing training data sets can improve transparency and help identify contamination issues.
- Contaminated data sets often perform better, challenging assumptions about their impact on overall performance.
- Task contamination detection is complicated by data formatting and keyword variations.
- Instruction fine-tuning alone does not account for performance increases in GPT-3 series models.
- Open models rarely show significant improvements over majority baselines without task contamination.
