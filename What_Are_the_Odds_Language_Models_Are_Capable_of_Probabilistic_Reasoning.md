# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss language models' (LMs) capabilities in numerical reasoning, focusing on probabilistic tasks like estimating percentiles, drawing samples, and calculating probabilities.

# IDEAS:
- Language models excel in linguistic tasks but struggle with numerical reasoning.
- Specific prompts can enhance LM performance in numerical reasoning tasks.
- Contextualizing individual measurements within a population is crucial for meaningful data insights.
- Probabilistic reasoning involves summarizing data by focusing on key distribution parameters.
- Evaluating LM capabilities in probabilistic reasoning includes estimating percentiles, drawing samples, and calculating probabilities.
- Real-world context and assumptions like normal distribution impact LM performance.
- Idealized and real-world distributions are used to test LM performance.
- Health, finance, and climate data are used for real-world distribution analysis.
- Task one, estimating percentiles, shows the most variation in LM performance.
- Four LMs (Gemini 1.0 Ultra, GP4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA 3 70B) are assessed in zero-shot scenarios.
- Two types of shots: within distribution family and within distribution shots.
- Baseline comparison involves choosing the nearest target percentile value.
- Real-world distributions may not always follow a normal distribution but are treated as such for simplicity.
- Statistical tests show the closeness of normal approximation to real-world distributions.
- Providing examples from the same distribution improves LM performance.
- LMs perform interpolation rather than just repeating examples.
- Real-world context generally improves LM performance in probabilistic reasoning.
- Parametric assumptions like normal approximation enhance LM performance.
- Few-shot examples lead to better performance across health, finance, and climate data sets.

# INSIGHTS:
