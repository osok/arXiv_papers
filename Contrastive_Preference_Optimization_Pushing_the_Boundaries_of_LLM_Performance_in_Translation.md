# SUMMARY
The authors introduce Alma models, fine-tuned with monolingual and high-quality parallel data, and propose Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to enhance translation quality, achieving performance levels comparable to GPT-4 and WMT competition winners.

# IDEAS:
- Alma models are fine-tuned with extensive monolingual data in various languages.
- Smaller LLMs with 7 or 13 billion parameters underperform traditional translation models.
- Alma models outperform previous moderate-sized LLMs and even GPT-3.5 in translation tasks.
- CPO addresses limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by using curated preference data.
- CPO helps the model learn to generate better translations and reject worse ones.
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) requires double memory capacity and processing time.
- CPO only requires storage and processing of one policy, improving efficiency.
- High-quality human-written data can have quality issues affecting model performance.
- Training models solely to replicate reference translations may not be effective.
- Reference-free evaluation frameworks assess translation outputs without relying on gold standards.
- Kiwi XXL and X C M are reference-free models used for evaluating translation quality.
- CPO loss function includes preference learning and ensuring model alignment with preferred data.
- Using both parts of the CPO loss function together gives the best performance.
- Excluding data from either Alma or GPT-4 leads to a significant drop in performance.
- Artificially generated dispreferred data leads to a significant drop in performance.
- Alma R model achieves performance levels matching or surpassing GPT-4 and WMT winners.
- Training on metric-preferred data improves performance across other metrics.
- SFT on preferred data results in lower performance across all metrics.
- Reference-free models like Kiwi XXL and X C M are robust for constructing preference data.
- The quality of dispreferred data significantly impacts model performance.
- Alma models are trained using a compact dataset derived from Flores 200 data.
- The training setup includes a batch size of 128 and a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens.
- Alma 13B Laura is used as the initial checkpoint for training.
- The model is fine-tuned with a small amount of high-quality parallel data.
- The experiments focus on 10 translation directions including Czech to English and German to English.
- The results show significant improvements across all translation directions with CPO.

# INSIGHTS:
- Alma models use extensive monolingual data to enhance multilingual comprehension.
- CPO improves translation quality by learning preferences from curated data.
- Reference-free evaluation frameworks offer robust assessment without relying on gold standards.
- High-quality human-written data can still have quality issues affecting model performance.
- Training models solely to replicate reference translations may not be effective.
- CPO resolves memory and speed inefficiencies of DPO by requiring only one policy.
- Using both parts of the CPO loss function together gives the best performance.
- Excluding data from either Alma or GPT-4 leads to a significant drop in performance.
- Artificially generated dispreferred data leads to a significant drop in performance.
- Alma R model achieves performance levels matching or surpassing GPT-4 and WMT winners.
