# SUMMARY
The authors introduce Alma models, fine-tuned with monolingual and high-quality parallel data, and propose Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to enhance translation quality, surpassing GPT-4 and WMT winners.

# IDEAS:
- Alma models fine-tune decoder-only LLMs with extensive monolingual data in various languages.
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with small but high-quality parallel data improves translation generation.
- Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) addresses SFT limitations using specially curated preference data.
- Alma R, the fine-tuned model using CPO, matches or surpasses GPT-4 and WMT competition winners.
- CPO helps the model learn to generate better translations and reject worse ones.
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) requires double memory capacity and processing time.
- CPO only requires storage and processing of one policy, improving efficiency.
- CPO uses high-quality but not flawless translations as dispreferred data to refine details.
- Training models solely to replicate reference translations may not be the most effective approach.
- Reliance on reference-based evaluation could be flawed due to substandard references.
- Reference-free evaluation frameworks assess translation outputs from Alma 13B Laura and GPT-4.
- Advanced models can sometimes surpass the quality of gold standard references.
- Fine-tuning with superior translations as references doesn't prevent generating suboptimal translations.
- CPO loss combines log likelihood supervised fine-tuning loss applied to preferred data.
- CPO facilitates preference learning with the same space and time complexity as common SFT methods.
- CPO significantly enhances model capabilities, comparable to or surpassing GPT-4 and WMT winners.
- Human-labeled preference data is available for two translation directions: English to Chinese and English to German.
- The model is trained in a many-to-many multilingual machine translation manner.
- The fine-tuning process involves a batch size of 128 and a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens.
- CPO demonstrates significant improvements across all translation directions compared to SFT and DPO.
- Training on metric-preferred data consistently improves performance across other metrics.
- Using reference-free models like Kiwi XXL and XC for constructing preference data is robust and valid.
- Both Alma and GPT-4 contribute to improving the model's performance.
- Quality of dispreferred data significantly impacts model performance.
