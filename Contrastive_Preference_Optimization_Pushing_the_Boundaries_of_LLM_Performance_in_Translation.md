# SUMMARY
The authors introduce Alma models, fine-tuned with monolingual and high-quality parallel data, and propose Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to enhance translation quality, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4 and WMT competition winners.

# IDEAS:
- Alma models are fine-tuned with extensive monolingual data in various languages.
- Smaller LLMs with 7 billion or 13 billion parameters don't perform as well as traditional translation models.
- Alma models are further fine-tuned with high-quality parallel data to guide translation generation.
- Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) addresses limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- CPO uses specially curated preference data to train the Alma model.
- Alma R, the fine-tuned model using CPO, matches or surpasses GPT-4 and WMT competition winners.
- Human-written parallel data can be lower quality than system-generated translations.
- Training models solely to replicate reference translations may not be the most effective approach.
- CPO offers advantages in memory efficiency, speed, and effectiveness in improving translation quality.
- CPO breaks the bottleneck inherent in SFT's reference mimicking learning process.
- Target references in machine translation tasks are crucial for minimizing differences between predicted outputs and gold references.
- Reference-free evaluation frameworks can assess the quality of both gold standard references and model outputs.
- Advanced models' translations can sometimes surpass the quality of gold standard references.
- Fine-tuning models using superior translations as references can improve translation quality.
- CPO resolves memory and speed inefficiencies of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
- CPO facilitates preference learning with the same space and time complexity as common supervised fine-tuning methods.
- Preference data includes triplet preferences with high-quality but not flawless translations.
- Experiments focus on 10 translation directions using a compact training data set derived from Flores 200.
- Alma 13B Laura model is used as the initial checkpoint for training.
- CPO significantly enhances Alma models' capabilities, surpassing GPT-4 and WMT winners.
- Training on metric-preferred data consistently improves performance across other metrics.
- Using reference-free models like Kiwi XXL and XC for constructing preference data is robust and valid.
- Ablation study shows the importance of different components of the CPO loss function.
- Both Alma and GPT-4 contribute to improving model performance in preference data selection.
