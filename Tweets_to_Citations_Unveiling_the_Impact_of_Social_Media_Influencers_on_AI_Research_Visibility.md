# SUMMARY
The paper explores the role of social media influencers in curating and promoting AI/ML research, focusing on two influential users. It examines the impact of their endorsements on citation counts and highlights the need for balanced curation practices.

# IDEAS:
- The number of AI/ML conference papers is growing exponentially, changing scholarly knowledge sharing.
- Sharing pre-prints online allows early access to research, often months before official publication.
- Social media influencers play a key role in curating and making research visible in the AI/ML community.
- Influencers like Akore AAL and Aaron Comat Suaki act as journalists, highlighting important works.
- Over-reliance on a select group of curators could unintentionally skew the research landscape.
- Responsible curation practices are essential to maintain a balanced research ecosystem.
- Papers endorsed by influencers receive statistically higher citations compared to non-endorsed papers.
- Influencers' endorsements significantly affect the citation count of shared papers.
- The study uses control samples matched by publication details and text embeddings to ensure quality.
- Influencers' sharing practices are now a significant indicator of future research impact through citations.
- There is a geographical bias in papers shared by influencers, favoring US-based research.
- The gender distribution among authors of shared papers shows a male-dominated authorship.
- Social media platforms have been studied as influential means of scholarly communication for over a decade.
- Twitter presence is a predictor of higher citation count in medical publications.
- The study focuses on top-down dissemination from singular influencers with many followers.
- Influencers should maintain journalistic integrity by showcasing diverse research topics and authors.
- Conference organizers should engage in discussions on evolving the conference system to manage submissions.
- The study uses retrospective cohort studies to compare citation counts of shared and non-shared papers.
- Influencers' tweets correlate with higher citation counts, indicating a shift in how papers are found and read.
- The study highlights the need for balanced and diverse curation practices in the AI/ML community.

# INSIGHTS:
