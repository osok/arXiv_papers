- Perturbing tokens in the prefix caused a significant drop in exact match scores.
- Non-memorized paragraphs were more susceptible to perturbations than memorized ones.
- Differing levels of stability were observed between memorized and non-memorized content.
- Gradient flow patterns for memorized paragraphs were distinct in lower layers.
- Attention head 2 and layer 1 were crucial components for memorization.
- Gradient-based parameter attribution revealed differing gradient flow patterns.
- Concentration of gradient flow was notable in lower layers for memorized content.
- A contrastive objective aimed to alter memorized continuations while preserving non-memorized ones.
- Sparse unlearning techniques focused on masking out parameters with low gradient values.
- Editing memorized paragraphs optimized only a small percentage of high gradient weights.
- Analysis of activation gradients highlighted the role of specific model components in memorization.
- Attention head 2 in layer 1 exhibited a strong correlation with rare tokens.
- The correlation suggested a mechanism where the model computes a unique signature for each paragraph.
- The study provided insights into the memorization process within language models.
- The introduction of a contrastive objective influenced the model's behavior.
- Sparse unlearning techniques demonstrated efficacy in optimizing high gradient weights.
- The study aligned with previous research findings on gradient flow patterns.
