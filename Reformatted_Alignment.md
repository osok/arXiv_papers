# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "realign," a method to enhance existing instruction data quality for better alignment with human values. It involves defining criteria, augmenting retrieval, and reformatting responses. Realign significantly improves math reasoning, general alignment, and factuality with minimal labor and fewer errors.

# IDEAS:
- Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values involves fine-tuning using synthetic or human-annotated data.
- Quality of instruction data is crucial for effective LLM alignment.
- Manual creation of high-quality data is labor-intensive and difficult to scale.
- Automating extraction of high-quality instructions from existing datasets faces challenges like factual inaccuracies.
- Realign focuses on improving existing instruction data quality rather than creating new data.
- Realign involves three steps: criteria definition, retrieval augmentation, and reformatting.
- Criteria definition specifies human preferences for response formats in 46 scenarios.
- Retrieval augmentation enhances knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating additional information.
- Reformatting aligns responses with criteria and evidence, ensuring well-structured outputs.
- Realign leverages human preferences and LLMs' generative capabilities for better alignment.
- Realign significantly boosts math reasoning skills and general alignment abilities.
- Realign offers automatic data quality improvement with minimal labor and fewer factual errors.
- Instruction selection aims to identify high-quality samples from large datasets for training.
- Instruction following difficulty (IFD) metric evaluates data by identifying discrepancies between model responses and autonomous generation capabilities.
- Instruction tuning enhances models' ability to follow instructions and align with human values.
- Realign improves response quality through criteria definition, retrieval augmentation, and reformatting.
- Non-knowledge intensive tasks are reorganized with specific formats for better responses.
- Knowledge-intensive tasks incorporate retrieved evidence for more accurate responses.
- Length filtering ensures reformatted responses are not significantly shorter than original ones.
- Task-based filtering prevents errors from spreading when classifying tasks.
- Realign model is evaluated on various datasets for general alignment, math reasoning, factuality, and readability.
- Realign improves readability by tailoring different formats for different tasks.
- Realign enhances cross-domain performance in math reasoning tasks.
- Realign's retrieval augmentation improves factuality in responses.
- Realign's adaptive rewriting method selects responses based on edit distance.
- Realign has little to no adverse effect on knowledge-based tasks.
- Ablation studies show the importance of retrieval augmentation and adaptive rewriting in realign's effectiveness.
