# SUMMARY
The paper defines a pre-training loss function, optimizes model parameters using computational methods, and minimizes training and inference costs considering hardware utilization.

# IDEAS:
- Pre-training loss function is defined as l n DTR, where n is parameters and DTR is tokens.
- Scaling laws from the Chinchilla paper are used to derive the parametric loss function.
- Constants a, b, e, Alpha, and beta are fitted to the parametric loss function.
- Assumption: demand for inference is independent of model size and token count.
- Models of the same quality but different parameter counts receive the same number of requests.
- Objective: minimize the sum of training and inference flops with pre-training loss constraint.
- Standard approximation of flops for Transformer models: 6n per training token and 2n per inference token.
- Computational methods are used due to complexity in determining optimal parameters and tokens analytically.
- Newton root finding method is used to solve for optimal parameter and token counts.
- Objective modified to estimate real-world cost of inference considering hardware utilization.
- Parameters for training and inference cost per flop: Center and cinf.
- Training, inference input, and inference output model flops utilization (mfus) are considered.
- New objective: minimize total cost of training and inference under pre-training loss constraint.
- Approximations for flops for Transformer models account for heterogeneous hardware utilization and costs.
- Comparison of inference-adjusted models' flop counts, parameters, and pre-training tokens to Chinchilla models.
- Tradeoff between flops and cost is illustrated with specific examples of cost reductions and optimizations.
