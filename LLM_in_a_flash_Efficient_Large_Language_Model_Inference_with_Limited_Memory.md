# SUMMARY
The text discusses optimizing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Falcon by storing parameters on flash memory, leveraging sparsity, and using techniques like windowing and row-column bundling to minimize data transfer and maximize throughput.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 require significant computational power and memory.
- LLMs can have hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters.
- Standard method loads entire model into device's DRAM, which has limitations.
- A model with 7 billion parameters needs more than 14 GB of memory in half precision.
- Most edge devices cannot handle the memory requirements of large LLMs.
- Storing model parameters on flash memory offers at least 10 times more capacity than DRAM.
- Flash memory can smartly load necessary parameters, eliminating need to fit entire model in DRAM.
- LLMs have high sparsity in their feedforward network (FFN) layers.
- Models like OPT and Falcon have more than 90% of their parameters as zero.
- Only load parameters from flash memory that have nonzero input or predicted nonzero output.
- Introduce cost model considering flash memory, DRAM, and computing cores (CPU/GPU).
- Techniques to minimize data transfer: windowing and row-column bundling.
- Windowing reuses activations from recently computed tokens, reducing IO requests.
- Row-column bundling reads bigger contiguous chunks from flash memory, increasing throughput.
- Predict FFN sparsity to avoid loading zeroed-out parameters.
- Load only 2% of FFN layer from flash for each inference query using windowing and sparsity prediction.
- Static memory pre-allocation minimizes transfers within DRAM, reducing inference latency.
- Flash loading strategies can run models 2x larger than device's DRAM capacity.
- Speed up inference by 4 to 5x on CPU and 20 to 25x on GPU compared to naive implementation.
- Flash memory systems perform optimally with large sequential reads but not smaller random reads.
- Reading larger chunks of data and parallelized reads maximize flash memory throughput.
- Bundling columns and rows together in flash memory increases chunk size and speed.
- Pre-allocate all necessary memory in DRAM to avoid frequent reallocation during inference.
- Use sliding window technique to manage neuron data, keeping recent subset of input tokens in memory.
- Larger values of K result in less data being loaded for each new token.
- Multi-threading enhances data retrieval efficiency from flash memory.
- Predictors with higher rank reduce false negatives in neuron activation prediction.
- Windowing method significantly reduces need for fresh data loading during inference.

# INSIGHTS:
- LLMs' high sparsity allows selective loading of only necessary parameters from flash memory.
- Windowing and row-column bundling techniques minimize data transfer and maximize throughput.
- Flash loading strategies enable running models larger than device's DRAM capacity efficiently.
- Efficient memory management in DRAM reduces inference latency significantly.
- Multi-threading enhances data retrieval efficiency from flash memory.
