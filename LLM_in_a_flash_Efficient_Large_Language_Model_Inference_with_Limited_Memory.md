# SUMMARY
The text discusses optimizing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and PALM by storing parameters on flash memory instead of DRAM, leveraging sparsity, and using techniques like windowing and row-column bundling to minimize data transfer and maximize throughput.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and PALM require significant computational power and memory.
- LLMs can have hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters.
- Standard methods load the entire model into DRAM, which has limitations.
- A model with 7 billion parameters needs more than 14 GB of memory in half-precision format.
- Flash memory has at least 10 times more capacity than DRAM.
- Storing model parameters on flash memory can overcome DRAM limitations.
- LLMs have a high degree of sparsity in their feedforward network (FFN) layers.
- Models like OPT and Falcon have more than 90% of their parameters as zero.
- Only load parameters from flash memory that have nonzero input or predicted nonzero output.
- Introduce a cost model considering flash memory, DRAM, and computing cores (CPU/GPU).
- Techniques to minimize data transfer: windowing and row-column bundling.
- Windowing loads parameters for only the past few tokens, reusing recent activations.
- Row-column bundling reads larger contiguous chunks from flash memory.
- Predict FFN sparsity to avoid loading zeroed-out parameters.
- Load only 2% of the FFN layer from flash for each inference query.
- Static memory pre-allocation minimizes transfers within DRAM, reducing latency.
- Flash loading strategies can run models 2x larger than the device's DRAM capacity.
- Speed up inference by 4 to 5x on CPU and 20 to 25x on GPU compared to naive implementation.
- Flash memory systems perform optimally with large sequential reads.
- High bandwidth is not replicated for smaller random reads due to multiphase nature.
- Strategies: reading larger chunks of data and parallelized reads.
- Efficient weight storage layout enhances average chunk length, boosting bandwidth.
- Pre-allocation strategy and data structure minimize frequent reallocation in DRAM.
- Sliding window technique manages neuron data selectively for recent input tokens.
- Experiments show significant latency improvement using proposed methods.
- Multi-threading enhances data retrieval efficiency from flash memory.
- Predictors with different ranks reduce false negatives and positives in neuron activation.
- Windowing method significantly reduces fresh data loading needs.
- Proposed methods are 9 to 10 times faster than baseline approaches.

# INSIGHTS:
- LLMs' high sparsity allows selective parameter loading, optimizing memory use.
- Flash memory's larger capacity can store entire models, overcoming DRAM limits.
- Techniques like windowing and row-column bundling enhance flash memory throughput.

- Static memory pre-allocation reduces DRAM transfer latency during inference.
- Efficient weight storage layout in flash memory boosts read bandwidth.
- Sliding window technique optimizes neuron data management for recent tokens.
- Multi-threading improves data retrieval efficiency from flash memory.
- Combining cost modeling, sparsity prediction, and hardware awareness optimizes inference.
