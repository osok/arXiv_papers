# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Retrieval Pre-trained Transformer (RPT), a model that improves large language models (LLMs) by training the retriever and language model together, reducing computational costs and enhancing performance.

- Previous REALM models didn't train the retriever and language model together.
- The Retrieval Pre-trained Transformer (RPT) trains both components from scratch.
- RPT uses causal cross-attention (CCA) to integrate retrieved data into the language model.
- RPT introduces a special loss function to train the retriever effectively.
- RPT focuses on modeling extensive documents like books, articles, and code.
- RPT showed lower perplexity across all tasks compared to previous models.
- RPT retrieves high-quality data chunks compared to lexical-based retrievers.

- RPT is trained on sequences of 16,384 tokens split across four devices.
- Evaluated on datasets like PG-19, Books3, CodeParrot, and ArXiv.
- RPT outperforms baselines like Transformer XL and Retro on multiple datasets.
- Oracle models show potential for further improving retriever training.
- RPT SEM retrieves paraphrases with higher token overlap with target chunks.
- Lexical information alone is effective for datasets like CodeParrot.
