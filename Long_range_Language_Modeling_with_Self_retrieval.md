# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Retrieval Pre-trained Transformer (RPT), a model that improves large language models (LLMs) by training the retriever and language model together, reducing computational costs and enhancing performance.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but computationally expensive.
- Retrieval Augmented Language Modeling (REALM) reduces memory and computation needs.
- REALM improves factuality, relevance, and generalization without further training.
- Previous REALM models didn't train the retriever and language model together.
- The Retrieval Pre-trained Transformer (RPT) trains both components from scratch.
- RPT uses causal cross-attention (CCA) to integrate retrieved data into the language model.
- RPT showed lower perplexity across all tasks compared to previous models.
- RPT retrieves high-quality data chunks compared to lexical-based retrievers.
- RPT can be a stepping stone for next-gen pre-trained LLMs.
- Earlier models like KNN-LM used retrieval only during testing.
- Chunked Cross Attention (CCA) introduced retrieval at the training stage.
- TRIME model trained retriever and decoder jointly but used shallow integration.
- RPT uses a scoring language model for semantically focused retrieval.
- RPT is tested on extensive documents like books, articles, codes, and dialogues.
- RPT's architecture includes a learned retriever and CCA layers.
- The retriever calculates similarity scores for data chunks using bi-directional attention.
- Neighbor gating mechanism controls the impact of retrieved representations.
- Scheduled sampling reduces train-test mismatch by teaching the model to use its predictions.
- Sliding window attention mechanism ensures initial tokens refer back to previous ones.
- RPT is trained on sequences of 16,384 tokens split across four devices.
- The model uses rotary positional embedding and is trained for 500,000 steps.
- Evaluated on datasets like PG-19, Books3, CodeParrot, and ArXiv.
- RPT outperforms baselines like Transformer XL and Retro on most datasets.
- Oracle models consistently deliver the best perplexity results across all datasets.
- Semantic supervision enhances retrieval performance compared to lexical signals.
- RPT SEM retrieves paraphrases with higher token overlap with target chunks.
- Joint retriever-reader training methods improve performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
