# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Retrieval Pre-trained Transformer (RPT), a model that jointly trains a retriever and language model to improve efficiency and performance in large language models (LLMs). RPT uses causal cross-attention and a unique loss function to integrate retrieved data, showing improved perplexity and high-quality data retrieval.
