# SUMMARY
The proposed method aims to improve large language models (LLMs) by enhancing pre-training data quality through data pruning based on sample perplexity.

# IDEAS:
- The method focuses on selecting a high-quality subset of a larger data set.
- Perplexity is used as a metric to determine the difficulty of each sample.
- A small reference model calculates perplexity scores for data pruning.
- The goal is to enhance downstream performance while reducing training costs.
- Data pruning is based on selection rates: low, medium, and high perplexity.
- Low selection chooses samples with the lowest perplexity.
- Medium selection picks samples close to the median perplexity.
- High selection selects samples with the highest perplexity.
- The final model is trained on the pruned data set using next token prediction.
- Perplexity-based pruning improves downstream performance significantly.
- It enables models to achieve the same performance in fewer training steps.
- The technique is sensitive to the domain composition of the data set.
- It has been evaluated in non-standard training regimes like overtraining.
- Direct evaluation on downstream benchmarks ensures task performance assessment.
- Perplexity-based pruning complements existing rules-based and n-gram methods.
- It can handle large data sets by selecting high-quality samples.
- Offers flexibility in selecting samples based on different perplexity levels.
- Provides insights into how data quality impacts model performance.
- Consistently outperforms baseline models across different data sets and sizes.
- Experiments involved training a reference model on a random subset of data.
- Pruning was done based on low, medium, or high perplexity criteria.
- Final models trained on pruned data showed significant performance gains.
- Improvements of 1.89 and 1.51 for 1 billion parameter models were noted.
- Gains of 2.4 and 0.59 for 3 billion parameter models were observed.
- Perplexity-based pruning leads to increased training efficiency.
- It is effective in overtraining and data-constrained regimes.
- Test set perplexity may not always be a reliable evaluation metric.
- Models trained on pruned data may become biased estimators of original data.
- Performance on original data distribution may not reflect post-pruning quality.
