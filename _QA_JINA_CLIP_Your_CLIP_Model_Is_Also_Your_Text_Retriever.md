# SUMMARY

The paper addresses the underperformance of CLIP-style models in text retrieval tasks by proposing a novel three-stage training approach to enhance text-image and text-text matching.

# IDEAS:

- The proposed method aims to solve CLIP models' struggle with capturing richer information in longer texts.
- CLIP underperforms in all text retrieval tasks, hindering applications requiring larger text inputs.
- The novel approach focuses on contrastive training with large-scale image-caption pairs and text pairs.
- Jointly optimizing for representation alignment of both text-image and text-text pairs enhances model performance.
- A three-stage training approach includes training for text-image matching and text-text matching simultaneously.
- Utilizing datasets with varying text lengths prevents the model from unlearning how to handle long texts.
- The method aims to improve CLIP-style models' effectiveness in various applications requiring text understanding.
- Stage one involves training on text-image pairs with short captions and text-text pairs.
- Stage two introduces longer synthetic image captions while continuing training with text-text pairs.
- Stage three uses hard negatives to improve the text encoder's ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant text.
- Long AI-generated image captions are added to enhance performance on longer texts.
- The three stages ensure the model can handle both short and long text inputs effectively.
- Improved performance in text retrieval tasks, text-image retrieval, multimodal retrieval, and image generation.
- The model achieves competitive performance on cross-modal benchmarks like the CLIP Benchmark.
- The text encoder performs comparably to specialized text-only models on tasks like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark.
- The comprehensive training strategy results in enhanced text-text and text-image matching capabilities.
- The model is validated through various tasks and benchmarks, including comparisons with OpenAI CLIP and EVA CLIP.
- The model achieves an average recall at 5 of 85.8% across all retrieval benchmarks.
- The model's text encoder competes closely with top-tier text-only embedding models.
- The new method demonstrates high performance compared to existing models like OpenAI's CLIP and EVA CLIP.
- Limitations include handling longer texts in Texton tasks and underperformance in text retrieval tasks.
- Lack of available multimodal multi-target datasets impacts the model's overall performance.
- Discrepancy in text lengths between training data can degrade text-text performance in multimodal models.
