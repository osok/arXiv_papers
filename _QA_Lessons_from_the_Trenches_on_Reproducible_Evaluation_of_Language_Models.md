# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the Language Model Evaluation Harness (LMEH), addressing reproducibility and transparency in evaluating large language models, and providing a flexible evaluation library.

# IDEAS:
- Reproducibility and transparency are major challenges in evaluating large language models.
- Researchers face difficulties reproducing results due to inconsistencies, biases, and lack of access to original evaluation code.
- The LMEH aims to provide a flexible evaluation library for easy benchmarking of any model.
- Sharing exact prompts and code avoids copying results from other implementations.
- Performing qualitative analyses and measuring uncertainty improves evaluation rigor and transparency.
- Challenges in benchmark design include implementation difficulties and lack of agreement on fair comparisons.
- Comparing scores across different evaluation setups is difficult due to fast-changing progress in NLP research.
- LMEH allows for the contribution of evaluation tasks and integrations with novel LM implementations.
- Tasks are modular implementations using a common API, allowing for easy extension and sharing.
- Users can implement tasks via YAML-based configuration files or by subclassing the provided task class.
- The LM API allows arbitrary software libraries or language model architectures to extend a provided interface.
- The LM API simplifies evaluating different models by treating a neural language model and its tokenizer as a single system.
- LMEH supports three core types of requests: conditional log likelihoods, perplexities, and generation.
- Standardized implementations of common tasks ensure consistent reporting and evaluation.
- Versioning of tasks supports reproducible evaluation and confidence in novel results.
- Automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE offer reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and standardized assessment.
- Model-based metrics leveraging large language models as graders serve as proxies for human preference evaluation.
- Automated metrics help track progress and compare methods in a standardized manner.
- LMEH ensures reproducibility by providing standardized task implementations and versioning systems.
- Sensitivity to divergences in evaluation methodology impacts model performance comparisons.
- Different prompting and scoring styles can significantly affect model performance validity.
- Sharing full details of evaluation setups ensures rigorous comparisons across different setups.
- The LM API abstracts tokenizers within the LM class, treating the model and tokenizer as a single system.
