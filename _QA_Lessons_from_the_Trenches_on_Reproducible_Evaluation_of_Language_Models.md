# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the Language Model Evaluation Harness (LMEH), addressing reproducibility and transparency in evaluating large language models, and providing a flexible evaluation library.

# IDEAS:
- Reproducibility and transparency are major challenges in evaluating large language models.
- Researchers face difficulties reproducing results due to inconsistencies, biases, and lack of access to original evaluation code.
- LMEH aims to provide a flexible evaluation library as research infrastructure for evaluation.
- The library allows running any benchmark on any model easily.
- Sharing exact prompts and code avoids copying results from other implementations.
- LMEH performs qualitative analyses and measures and reports uncertainty to improve evaluation rigor.
- It addresses challenges in benchmark design, implementation difficulties, and fair comparisons across models.
- Comparing scores across different evaluation setups is challenging due to fast-changing progress in NLP research.
- LMEH provides a flexible evaluation library addressing transparent and reproducible evaluation of large language models.
- Tasks are modular implementations of evaluation tasks using a common API.
- Users can implement tasks via YAML-based configuration files or by subclassing the provided task class.
- The LM API allows arbitrary software libraries or language model architectures to extend a provided interface for LM objects.
- The LM API simplifies evaluating different models by treating a neural language model combined with its tokenizer as a single system.
- LMEH supports three core types of requests: conditional log likelihoods, perplexities, and generation.
- Standardized implementations of common tasks ensure consistent reporting and evaluation on the same prompts.
- Versioning of tasks supports qualitative analysis and statistical testing for reproducible evaluation.
- Automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE offer reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and standardized quantitative assessment.
- Model-based metrics leveraging large language models as graders serve as proxies for human preference evaluation.
- LMEH ensures reproducibility by providing standardized implementation and versioning of tasks.
- Sensitivity to divergences in evaluation methodology impacts model performance and comparison validity.
- Sharing full details of one's evaluation setup ensures rigorous comparisons across different setups.
