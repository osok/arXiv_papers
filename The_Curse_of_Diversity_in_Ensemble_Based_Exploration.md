# SUMMARY
The text discusses ensemble-based exploration in deep reinforcement learning, highlighting its benefits and the "curse of diversity," and introduces Cross Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) to mitigate this issue.

# IDEAS:
- Ensemble-based exploration involves training diverse agents that share data, common in deep reinforcement learning.
- Diverse ensembles allow exploring different strategies simultaneously during training without needing extra data.
- Combining learned strategies at test time creates a more robust overall strategy through voting or averaging.
- Each ensemble member mainly learns from data generated by others, known as off-policy learning.
- Off-policy learning is challenging and affects ensemble-based exploration, leading to the "curse of diversity."
- Experiments using the Arcade Learning Environment and MuJoCo benchmark showed individual ensemble members often perform worse.
- Combining ensemble strategies can sometimes compensate for performance drops but is not always effective.
- The curse of diversity diminishes the advantages of ensemble-based exploration.
- Cross Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) involves ensemble members learning each other's value functions as an auxiliary task.
- CERL can help alleviate the curse of diversity and outperform single-agent and ensemble-based approaches.
- The curse of diversity causes individual ensemble members to struggle with learning from diverse off-policy data.
- Individual ensemble members like bootstrapped DQN perform worse compared to single agents like double DQN.
- Combining learned policies at test time significantly boosts performance in many environments.
- The success of methods like bootstrapped DQN is mainly due to majority voting rather than improved exploration.
- Better exploration from a diverse ensemble is valuable but overshadowed by the curse of diversity.
- Future ensemble-based exploration applications should consider individual agents' performance.
- Developing improved ensemble algorithms that address the curse of diversity while retaining advantages is crucial.
- The low proportion of self-generated data for each member contributes to performance degradation.
- Inefficiency in learning from highly off-policy data also contributes to performance degradation.
- Increasing the size of the replay buffer can help improve performance by providing better coverage of state-action pairs.
- Reducing diversity by decreasing ensemble size and increasing shared layers can affect performance and diversity.
- CERL reduces diversity without compromising the benefits of policy aggregation, showing promising results.
- Ensemble-based exploration algorithms use multiple agents that share data to explore simultaneously.
- Few works address the challenges of learning from off-policy data generated by other agents.
- Some methods use multiple ensemble members per step instead of one per episode, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- Ensemble methods in reinforcement learning are used for robust value estimations and model predictions.
- Mutual distillation, where networks share knowledge through collaboration, is common in supervised learning.
- CERL differs as it uses auxiliary tasks to influence representations rather than distilling predictions.
