# SUMMARY
The text discusses ensemble-based exploration in deep reinforcement learning, highlighting its benefits and the "curse of diversity," and introduces Cross Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) to mitigate this issue.

# IDEAS:
- Ensemble-based exploration involves training diverse agents that share data, common in deep reinforcement learning.
- A diverse ensemble allows exploring different strategies simultaneously without needing extra data.
- Combining learned strategies at test time creates a more robust overall strategy through voting or averaging.
- Each ensemble member mainly learns from data generated by others, known as off-policy learning.
- Off-policy learning is challenging and affects ensemble-based exploration.
- Experiments using the Arcade Learning Environment and MuJoCo benchmark showed individual ensemble members often perform worse than single agents.
- Combining ensemble strategies can sometimes compensate for performance drops but is not always effective.
- The "curse of diversity" refers to the negative impact on individual ensemble members' performance.
- Cross Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) involves ensemble members learning each other's value functions as an additional task.
- CERL can help alleviate the curse of diversity and outperform both single-agent and ensemble-based approaches.
- The curse of diversity causes individual ensemble members to struggle with learning from diverse off-policy data.
- Individual ensemble members like bootstrapped DQN perform worse compared to single-agent counterparts like double DQN.
- Combining learned policies at test time significantly boosts performance in many environments.
- The success of methods like bootstrapped DQN is mainly due to majority voting rather than improved exploration.
- Better exploration from a diverse ensemble is valuable but overshadowed by the curse of diversity.
- Future ensemble-based exploration applications should consider the curse of diversity, especially in hyperparameter sweeps.
- The low proportion of self-generated data for each member contributes to performance degradation in ensembles.
- Inefficiency in learning from highly off-policy data also contributes to the curse of diversity.
- Increasing the size of the replay buffer can help improve performance by providing better coverage of state-action pairs.
- Reducing diversity by decreasing ensemble size and increasing shared layers can affect performance and diversity.
- CERL reduces diversity without compromising the benefits of policy aggregation, showing promising results.
- Ensemble-based exploration algorithms use multiple agents that share data to explore simultaneously.
- Few works address the challenges of learning from off-policy data generated by other agents.
- Some methods use multiple ensemble members per step instead of one per episode, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- Ensemble methods in reinforcement learning are used for robust value estimations and model predictions.
- Mutual distillation, where networks share knowledge through collaboration, is common in supervised learning and adapted to reinforcement learning.
- CERL differs as it uses auxiliary tasks to influence representations rather than distilling ensemble members' predictions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Ensemble-based exploration allows simultaneous strategy exploration without extra data but faces off-policy learning challenges.
- The curse of diversity causes individual ensemble members to perform worse due to off-policy learning difficulties.
- Combining learned strategies at test time can boost performance but doesn't always compensate for individual drops.
- Cross Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) mitigates the curse of diversity by sharing value functions among ensemble members.
- The success of bootstrapped DQN is more due to majority voting than improved exploration.
- Future applications should consider the curse of diversity, especially in hyperparameter sweeps with ensembles.
- Increasing replay buffer size can improve performance by covering more state-action pairs but isn't a consistent fix.
- Reducing ensemble size and increasing shared layers can affect performance and diversity in different environments.
- CERL shows promising results in improving individual and aggregate policies across various tasks without compromising benefits.
