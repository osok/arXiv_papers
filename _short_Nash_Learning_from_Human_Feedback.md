# SUMMARY
The paper presents a preference-based reinforcement learning model using human preferences, introducing a regularized preference model and the Nash MD algorithm for policy optimization.

# IDEAS:
- Preference-based RL learns from pairwise human preferences rather than scalar rewards.
- Existing reward models have limitations, prompting the need for preference-based approaches.
- Preference between actions is represented as a number between zero and one.
- The objective is to find a policy preferred over any alternative, defining a Nash equilibrium.
- A regularized version of the preference model incorporates a penalty mechanism using KL regularization.
- KL regularization quantifies divergence between the policy under consideration and a reference policy.
- The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the regularized model are confirmed.
- The Nash MD algorithm is a novel variant of mirror descent for approximating Nash equilibrium.
- The convergence of the Nash MD algorithm's last iterate to the Nash equilibrium is proven.
- KL divergence decays as O(1/t) in the Nash MD algorithm.
- Online convex optimization and extra gradient methods can approximate Nash equilibrium.
- The theoretical results are applied to the contextual Bandit setting with context-dependent policies and preferences.
- The Nash MD algorithm is modified for sequential token generation in language models.
- A general algorithm for computing the Nash equilibrium of the preference model is outlined.
- Policy parameters can be updated using either a model-based or model-free approach.
- Two alternative algorithms, Nash MDPG and Nash EMA PG, are introduced for generating second sample responses.
- The proposed approach provides a robust framework for future research and applications in preference-based RL.
- Human preferences offer a more nuanced understanding of desired outcomes compared to scalar rewards.
- Regularization helps in maintaining stability and convergence in preference-based models.
- Contextual Bandit settings allow for more dynamic and adaptable policy learning.

# INSIGHTS:
