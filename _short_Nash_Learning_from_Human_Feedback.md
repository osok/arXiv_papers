# SUMMARY
The paper presents a preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) model using human preferences, introducing a regularized preference model and the Nash MD algorithm for policy optimization.

# IDEAS:
- Preference-based RL learns from pairwise human preferences rather than scalar rewards.
- Existing reward models have limitations, prompting the need for preference-based approaches.
- Preference between actions is represented as a number between zero and one.
- The objective is to find a policy preferred over any alternative, defining a Nash equilibrium.
- A regularized version incorporates KL regularization to quantify policy divergence.
- The Nash MD algorithm is a novel variant of mirror descent for approximating Nash equilibrium.
- The convergence of the Nash MD algorithm's last iterate to Nash equilibrium is proven.
- Online convex optimization and extra gradient methods can also approximate Nash equilibrium.
- The theoretical results are applied to the contextual Bandit setting.
- Policies and preferences in the contextual Bandit setting depend on context.
- The Nash MD algorithm is modified for sequential token generation in language models.
- A general algorithm for computing the Nash equilibrium of the preference model is outlined.
- Policy parameters can be updated using model-based or model-free approaches.
- Two alternative algorithms, Nash MDPG and Nash EMA PG, are introduced for sample response generation.
- The approach provides a robust framework for future research and applications in preference-based RL.

# INSIGHTS:
- Preference-based RL offers a more nuanced approach by learning from human preferences.

- Sequential token generation in language models benefits from preference-based RL techniques.
- Model-based and model-free approaches offer flexibility in updating policy parameters.
- Nash MDPG and Nash EMA PG algorithms provide robust alternatives for response generation.
- Preference-based RL frameworks can significantly advance future research and practical applications.
