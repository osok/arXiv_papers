# SUMMARY
The study introduces "proxy tuning," a method to enhance large pre-trained language models without extensive fine-tuning or accessing internal weights. It uses a smaller tuned model to guide the larger model's predictions, showing improvements in various tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Proxy tuning uses a smaller, easily tuned model to guide larger language models.
- Large language models often require resource-intensive fine-tuning for specific tasks.
- Proxy tuning can be applied during the decoding phase without accessing internal weights.
- The method involves comparing predictions of a tuned smaller model with its untuned version.
- Proxy tuning shifts the base model's predictions based on differences from the smaller model.
- The method aims to match the performance of heavily tuned large models by tuning smaller ones.
- Proxy tuning can surpass direct instruction tuning in preserving learned knowledge.
- It is effective for domain adaptation, such as adapting pre-trained models to code.
- Proxy tuning improves task-specific fine-tuning for question answering and math problems.
- It promotes reasoning and stylistic tokens more than factual statements.
- Proxy tuning doesn't require tuning hyperparameters but allows for optional control.
- It enables customization of proprietary language models without accessing weights.
- The method adds a logit offset for every token based on differences from the smaller model.
- Proxy tuning closes the gap between base models and their directly tuned versions.
- It significantly reduces toxicity in responses compared to base models.
- Proxy tuning outperforms small tuned experts in most scenarios.
- Larger models don't necessarily outperform smaller, specifically tuned models.
- Fine-tuning large models with small task-specific experts greatly improves performance.
- Instruction tuning mainly influences reasoning and style rather than increasing knowledge.
- Introducing a hyperparameter allows control over the amount of modification in proxy tuning.
- Efficiently tuning larger models is a pressing challenge in adapting pre-trained models.
- Tuning at decoding time represents a new approach for efficient fine-tuning.
- Combining probability distributions from small and large models requires additional data and training.
