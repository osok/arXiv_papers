# SUMMARY
The paper proposes orthogonal fine-tuning (OFT) for text-to-image diffusion models to enhance controllability without losing pre-training generative performance. OFT preserves hyperspherical energy and improves generation quality, convergence speed, and stability.

# IDEAS:
- Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating images with specific and detailed attributes.
- Two key tasks: subject-driven generation and controllable generation.
- Fine-tuning strategies must balance efficient training with fewer adjustable parameters.
- Current fine-tuning methods don't guarantee preservation of pre-training generative performance.
- Euclidean distance alone isn't enough to capture the preservation of semantic information.
- Hyperspherical energy measures how uniformly neurons are distributed on the hypersphere.
- Orthogonal fine-tuning (OFT) applies an orthogonal transformation to all neurons.
- OFT adapts large text-to-image diffusion models without altering hyperspherical energy.
- Constrained orthogonal fine-tuning (COFT) limits angular deviation from the pre-trained model.
- OFT significantly improves generation quality, convergence speed, and fine-tuning stability.
- A new control consistency metric evaluates controllability by comparing control signals.
- OFT can be applied to any text-to-image diffusion model.
- OFT uses layer-shared orthogonal transformation to update neuron weights in a multiplicative manner.
- Neuron directions play a major role in storing semantic information.
- Fine-tuning neuron directions is more effective in modifying semantic information of images.
- Orthogonal transformation offers a good balance between flexibility and regularity.
- OFT maintains pairwise neuron angles, bringing regularity and stability in fine-tuning.
- COFT combines orthogonality and minimal changes in spherical energy measurement.
- OFT converges faster due to fine-tuning neurons on a smooth hypersphere manifold.
- OFT introduces no additional computational load during inference.
- OFT outperforms DreamBooth and LoRA in subject fidelity and control accuracy.
- OFT achieves better convergence and stability with fewer training data and parameters.
- COFT further enhances fine-tuning stability by limiting deviation from the pre-trained model.
- OFT is more parameter-efficient than LoRA in most cases.
- OFT can be used with Transformer models and convolution layers.
- OFT's block diagonal structure has meaningful interpretations for convolution layers.
- OFT's faster convergence is due to altering neuron directions effectively.
- Minimizing hyperspherical energy is beneficial in classification but not in generative models.
- OFT strikes a balance between flexibility and regularity, avoiding model collapse.
- COFT exemplifies the principle of balancing flexibility and regularity in fine-tuning.
