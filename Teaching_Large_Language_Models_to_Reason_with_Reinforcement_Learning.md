# SUMMARY
The section explores how reinforcement learning (RL) techniques enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Expert iteration outperforms other methods.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) are improving in tasks like mathematics, science, and computer programming.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and fine-tuning methods align LLMs with human preferences.
- Techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought enhance LLM reasoning abilities.
- RL has trained neural networks to plan and reason in complex game environments.
- Cicero combines an RL-trained planning agent with a dialogue-enhanced LLM for superior performance in Diplomacy.
- Applying RL to LLMs can improve their reasoning across various reward systems and starting points.
- Evaluating different RL algorithms on reasoning tasks involves question-answer pairs and Markov decision processes.
- Tokens act as both actions and evolving states in the Markov decision process.
- Different types of rewards include correct final answers, matching steps in a reference solution, and model-generated rewards.
- Performance is measured using majority scores, reranking scores, and pass scores.
- Expert iteration often outperforms more complex algorithms across most metrics and setups.
- The performance gap between pre-trained models and those fine-tuned with supervision narrows after RL fine-tuning.
- RL fine-tuning can improve both immediate answers and pass scores simultaneously.
- Deterministic dynamics favor direct behavior cloning and return-conditioned RL.
- Lack of sophisticated exploration during RL fine-tuning limits performance advantages.
- Expert iteration and return-conditioned RL are competitive with proximal policy optimization.
- Proximal policy optimization alternates between exploring strategies and refining the policy.
- Expert iteration starts with an initial guess of the best policy and refines it through exploration and exploitation.
- Return-conditioned RL trains policies to adjust actions based on desired outcomes.
- Outcome-based reward models (ORMs) predict the probability of steps leading to correct solutions.
- Expert iteration achieves the best performance with notable improvement in sample complexity.
- Reinforcement curriculum learning (RCRL) models struggle to distinguish between good and bad steps.
- Training data diversity and model initialization strategies are crucial for performance.
- Without supervised fine-tuning data, expert iteration still significantly boosts accuracy.
- RL training is sensitive to architecture and hyperparameters, especially for fine-tuning LLMs.
- Larger models engage in more diverse exploration, impacting performance on exploration data.
