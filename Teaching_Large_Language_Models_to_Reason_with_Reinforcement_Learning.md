# SUMMARY
The section discusses how reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It compares different RL algorithms, highlighting expert iteration's superior performance and sample efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) are improving in tasks like mathematics, science, and computer programming.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and fine-tuning methods align LLMs with human preferences.
- Advanced strategies like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought enhance LLM reasoning.
- RL has trained neural networks for complex games like AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and OpenAI Dota 2.
- Cicero combines RL-trained planning with dialogue-enhanced LLMs for near-superhuman Diplomacy performance.
- Applying RL to LLMs can improve reasoning across various reward systems and starting points.
- Evaluating RL algorithms on reasoning tasks involves question-answer pairs and Markov decision processes.
- Different rewards include correct final answers, matching steps in reference solutions, and model-generated rewards.
- Performance metrics include majority score, reranking score, and pass score based on sampling.
- Expert iteration often outperforms more complex algorithms across most metrics and setups.
- The performance gap between pre-trained and supervised fine-tuned models narrows after RL fine-tuning.
- RL fine-tuning can improve both immediate answers and pass scores by generating diverse training examples.
- Deterministic dynamics in reasoning tasks favor direct behavior cloning and return-conditioned RL.
- Lack of sophisticated exploration during RL fine-tuning limits proximal policy optimization's advantages.
- Expert iteration and return-conditioned RL are competitive with proximal policy optimization.
- Proximal policy optimization alternates between exploring strategies and refining policies based on outcomes.
- Expert iteration refines initial policy guesses through exploration and exploitation.
- Return-conditioned RL adjusts actions based on desired outcomes, training models to predict best actions.
- Outcome-based reward models (ORMs) verify and rank solutions proposed by models.
- Training data diversity and model initialization strategies are crucial for effective RL fine-tuning.
- Expert iteration achieves significant improvements in accuracy metrics over baseline models.
- Reinforcement curriculum learning (RCRL) struggles to distinguish between good and bad steps.
- Without supervised fine-tuning data, expert iteration still significantly boosts pre-trained model accuracy.
- Proximal policy optimization requires fewer samples but has similar training duration due to memory demands.
- Dense rewards have minimal impact on performance, potentially encouraging overfitting to exact solutions.
