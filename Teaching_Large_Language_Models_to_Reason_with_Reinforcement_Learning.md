# SUMMARY
The section explores how reinforcement learning (RL) techniques enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) across various reward schemes and model initializations.

# IDEAS:
- RL techniques improve LLMs' reasoning abilities across various reward schemes and model initializations.
- Expert iteration often outperforms more complex algorithms across most metrics and setups.
- RL fine-tuning can improve both test time performance metrics, addressing limitations in supervised fine-tuning.
- Exploration is crucial for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.
- Proximal policy optimization (PPO) alternates between exploring strategies and refining the policy.
- Expert iteration starts with an initial guess of the best policy and refines it iteratively.
- Return conditioned RL trains policies that adjust actions based on desired outcomes.
- Outcome-based reward models (ORMs) predict the probability of a sequence leading to a correct solution.
- Expert iteration achieves the best performance with notable improvement in sample complexity.
- RL fine-tuning generates a more diverse set of training examples.
- Deterministic dynamics favor direct behavior cloning and return conditioned RL.
- Lack of sophisticated exploration limits the performance advantages of PPO.
- Expert iteration and PPO require a similar number of samples to reach their best performance.
- Performance gap between pre-trained models and those fine-tuned with supervision narrows significantly after RL fine-tuning.
- RL fine-tuning can improve both immediate answers and pass scores simultaneously.
- Balanced ratio of positive to negative labels leads to poorer performance in RCRL models.
- Dense rewards do not significantly benefit performance and may encourage overfitting.
- Larger models engage in more diverse exploration, impacting performance positively.
- RL training is sensitive to architecture and hyperparameters, especially for fine-tuning LLMs.
- Sampling parameters greatly affect exploration during RL training.
- Reduced training time in RL fine-tuning can achieve similar or better performance compared to static supervised fine-tuning.
