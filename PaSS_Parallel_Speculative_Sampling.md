# SUMMARY
Researchers propose Parallel Speculative Sampling (PASS) to enhance large language models' efficiency by generating multiple tokens simultaneously, reducing memory and processing time.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models require many parameters, leading to high memory and longer processing times.
- Transformers used autoregressively need new model calls for each token, increasing time and memory.
- Smaller models can approximate larger models' generation but create memory and running time bottlenecks.
- Parallel decoding generates multiple tokens at once, avoiding the need for a second model.
- Parallel Speculative Sampling (PASS) uses look-ahead embeddings for parallel decoding.
- PASS ensures lossless quality of generations without requiring a second model.
- Look-ahead embeddings enhance predictive capabilities by adding steps to the input sequence.
- PASS involves two phases: drafting and validation, ensuring at least one token is added per call.
- The method guarantees speed-up by producing and accepting multiple tokens per iteration.
- Processing additional tokens is negligible due to memory-bound autoregressive generation.
- Look-ahead embeddings are trained on a small dataset, minimizing memory overhead.
- Experiments used the 7B LLaMA model with English Wikipedia and Python datasets.
- Top-K sampling with K=10 and temperature of 0.8 was used for text and code completion.
- Fine-tuning look-ahead embeddings is crucial for predicting future tokens accurately.
- Running time decreased up to six look-ahead steps but negated benefits beyond that.
- PASS improved running time by up to 30% without degrading generation quality.
- The method was tested on text and code completion tasks, showing significant time reduction.
- The approach ensures the same distribution of tokens as the original large model.
- Existing speculative sampling methods add small models, increasing memory overhead.
- PASS avoids modifications to the large language model, making it suitable for pre-trained models.
