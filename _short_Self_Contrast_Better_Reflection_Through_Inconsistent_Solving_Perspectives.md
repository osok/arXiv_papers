# SUMMARY
The paper investigates the reflection capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various benchmarks, focusing on initial response, evaluation, and revision phases.

# IDEAS:
- Reflection capabilities of LLMs did not significantly change before and after reflection for most benchmarks.
- Smaller LLMs demonstrated a lesser ability to reflect, occasionally exhibiting negative impacts.
- The quality of the initial response significantly impacts the reflection results.
- Replacing weaker LLMs with stronger ones improved the reflection performance of weaker LLMs.
- A significant number of invalid reflection cases were found where errors in the initial response were not corrected.
- Overconfident or inconsistent feedback was observed in the majority of invalid and toxic reflection scenarios.
- The self-control algorithm encourages LLMs to create diverse perspectives for problem-solving.
- Contrasting differences between various solutions helps in identifying discrepancies.
- A checklist-based reflection process was developed to resolve inconsistencies.
- The self-cast algorithm achieved a modest improvement over standard reflection using self-evaluation.
- Generating multiple self-curated prompts representing different solving perspectives was encouraged.
- Contrasting differences between each pair of responses helps explore underlying reasons behind discrepancies.
- Abstracted checklists from pairwise contrastive differences were used to prompt LLMs to revise inconsistent steps.
- This comprehensive approach significantly enhanced the significance levels, reducing uncertainty in the reflection process.
- Feedback analysis revealed a significant number of invalid reflection cases.
- Errors in the initial response were not corrected in many cases.
- Overconfident or inconsistent feedback was common in invalid and toxic reflection scenarios.
- Encouraging diverse perspectives for problem-solving can improve reflection capabilities.
- Identifying discrepancies between solutions is crucial for effective reflection.
- A checklist-based approach can help resolve inconsistencies in LLM reflections.
