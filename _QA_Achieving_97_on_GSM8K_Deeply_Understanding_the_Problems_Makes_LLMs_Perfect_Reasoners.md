# SUMMARY
The paper addresses the limited reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, introducing DUP prompting to enhance understanding and accuracy.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs often struggle with fully understanding complex problems, leading to errors in reasoning steps.
- DUP prompting aims to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding by extracting core questions and problem-solving information.
- The method works in three stages: extracting the core question, extracting problem-solving information, and generating answers.
- DUP prompting significantly enhances reasoning performance across various benchmarks, outperforming zero-shot and few-shot methods.
- The core question extraction template helps LLMs focus on the main goal of the input question.
- Problem-solving information extraction lists necessary conditions for reasoning, crucial for solving the problem.
- Incorporating core questions and problem-solving information guides LLMs to generate accurate reasoning processes.
- Theoretical benefits include enhanced comprehensive understanding and more accurate replies by LLMs.
- DUP prompting outperforms existing methods like zero-shot COT, plan-and-solve, least-to-most, manual COT, and auto-COT.
- Experiments validated DUP prompting across 10 reasoning benchmark datasets covering arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.
- DUP prompting achieved state-of-the-art results on certain arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.
- An ablation study confirmed each stage of DUP prompting is crucial for effective problem-solving.
- Compatibility with self-consistency decoding further enhances DUP prompting performance.
- Significant improvements were seen in arithmetic reasoning datasets with DUP prompting compared to zero-shot COT.
- DUP prompting achieved 94.2% accuracy on the SVAMP dataset and 97.1% on the GSM8K dataset in GPT-4 settings.
- Few-shot methods within GPT-3.5 turbo settings showed superior performance with DUP prompting.
- Limitations include potential performance reduction with smaller parameter LLMs and quality dependency on extracted information.
- Reducing inference cost may sacrifice accuracy, as seen in comparisons between DUP and DUP-S prompting.
- Specific types of errors like understanding, process, and calculation errors may still need improvement.

# INSIGHTS:
