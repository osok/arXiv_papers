# SUMMARY
Adam Mini aims to reduce memory consumption in training large language models by optimizing Adam's second-order momentum, improving efficiency and performance.

# IDEAS:
- Adam Mini reduces memory requirements of Adam's second-order momentum component in LLM training.

- Reduces communication overhead among GPUs and CPUs, lowering the threshold for training LLMs.
- Encourages researchers with limited GPU resources to train large models.
- Maintains or improves Adam's performance while drastically reducing memory usage.
- Partitions model parameters into blocks based on the Hessian structure for Transformers.
- Assigns a single learning rate to each parameter block outside the embedding layer.
- Uses the mean of Adam's second-order values to determine learning rates for each block.
- Ensures different heads receive distinct learning rates in Transformers.
- Achieves significant memory savings, up to 45% to 50% of Adam's memory cost.
- Higher throughput due to reduced communication among CPUs and GPUs.
- Potential for further optimization in learning rate design through fine-grained analysis.
- Shows low sensitivity to hyperparameters, ensuring robust performance across settings.
- Validated through experiments on various tasks, including pre-training and fine-tuning.
- Compared with AdamW and other memory-efficient methods like AdaFactor and SM3.
- Tested on non-LLM tasks like training ResNet-18 on ImageNet and diffusion models on CelebA.
- Achieved comparable or better performance than AdamW on various tasks.
- Saved 33.1% wall clock time for pre-training LLaMA 2 7B on 6 A100-80GB GPUs.
- Reduced memory cost by 45% to 50%, saving up to 17.7% to 18% of Adam's memory.
- Does not address memory consumption of Adam's first-order momentum component.
- Focuses primarily on reducing memory usage of second-order momentum.
- Potential for further optimization by considering both first and second-order momentum components.
