# SUMMARY
The section discusses generative image models using fine-tuned adapters, introducing Stylus, a system that automates adapter selection to enhance image quality and diversity.

# IDEAS:
- Fine-tuned adapters are now the norm in generative image models.
- Customized image creation with less storage is possible using fine-tuned adapters.
- Open-source platforms allow communities to create and exchange adapters and model checkpoints.
- Over 100,000 adapters exist, with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) being the primary fine-tuning method.
- Users manually combine multiple adapters on existing checkpoints for high-quality images.
- Automatic adapter selection based on user prompts poses unique challenges.
- Efficiently retrieving adapters requires converting them into lookup embeddings.
- User prompts often imply multiple highly specific tasks in image generation.
- Combining multiple adapters can impact image quality and introduce biases.
- Stylus interprets user prompts to retrieve and combine relevant adapters.
- Stylus operates through a three-stage framework: refiner, retriever, and composer.
- The refiner precomputes concise descriptions of adapters as lookup embeddings.
- The retriever assesses the relevance of each embedding against the user's prompt.
- The composer breaks down the prompt into tasks and assigns relevant adapters.
- Stylus avoids introducing biased concepts detrimental to image generation.
- Stylus maintains high image diversity by using different adapters for each task.
- Stylus Docs is an adapter dataset containing 75,000 LoRAs with pre-computed documentation.
- Stylus outperforms popular stable diffusion checkpoints in visual fidelity and image diversity.
- Stylus can be extended to various image-to-image application domains.
- Creating embeddings for adapters is challenging without access to training datasets.
- The composer segments the prompt into tasks based on keywords.
- The composer can be trained with human-labeled data or use a large language model (LLM).
- Stylus's composer outperforms existing rankers like Cohere and Rank English v2.0.
- Masking strategy involves using binary masks for each task to generate diverse combinations of adapters.
- Adjusting an adapter's weight prevents image saturation issues.
- Stylus Docs dataset includes a large number of LoRAs from popular model repositories.
- Human assessments show a preference for Stylus over existing model checkpoints.
- Stylus improves visual fidelity and alignment with user preferences.
- VM is used as a judge to evaluate textual alignment and visual fidelity.
- Stylus demonstrates higher diversity in approximately 60% of cases compared to stable diffusion checkpoints.
- Stylus outperforms retrieval-based methods in terms of CLIP and FID scores.
- Stylus adds 12.1 seconds to the image generation time, with the composer accounting for 8.5 seconds.
- Stylus is effective in image translation and inpainting tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
