- Video tokenizer uses video patches as basic units for learning video representations, also with s=14.
- Farthest point sampling samples a representative skeleton from original points at a fixed sampling ratio of one qu.
- K nearest neighbor method groups approximate points in point cloud data.
- Audio spectrogram tokenizer represents an audio sample as a single-channel image with Tal F=128, s=16.
- Transformer blocks with cross-modal reparameterization enhance interaction between different modalities.
- Cross-modal reparameterization involves reparameterizing the layer with parameters of its counterpart in another modality.
