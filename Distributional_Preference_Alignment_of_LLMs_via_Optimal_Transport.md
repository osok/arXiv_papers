# SUMMARY
The text discusses aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences using methods like AOT, DPO, and KTO to minimize harmful content.

# IDEAS:
- Aligning LLMs with human preferences ensures safety and compliance with ethical standards.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RHF) fine-tunes LLMs to maximize rewards.
- Direct preference optimization (DPO) uses likelihood ratios between LLM policy and reference models.
- Unpaired data settings use distinct marginals of chosen and rejected prompt-response pairs.
- The KTO method maximizes the margin between chosen and rejected rewards.
- Alignment via optimal transport (AOT) focuses on distributional alignment.
- AOT induces stochastic dominance of chosen rewards over rejected ones.
- AOT optimizes a one-dimensional optimal transport problem efficiently.
- AOT outperforms other alignment strategies like DPO and KTO.
- First-order stochastic dominance ensures distributional preference alignment.
- DPO assigns high rewards to positive responses and low rewards to negative responses.
- Distributional preference constraints align policies based on optimal transport problems.
- Soft sorting enhances optimization by incorporating entropic regularization.
- Assumptions about OT cost, reward, and policy hypothesis class aid analysis.
- Sample complexity analysis shows dominance violation diminishes as sample size increases.
- Experiments evaluated AOT on various LLMs and datasets.
- AOT performed well on benchmarks like Alpaca Eval and Open LLM Benchmark.
- Training used 8100 GPUs and took about an hour per model.
- AOT aligned LLMs outperformed competitors on Alpaca Eval leaderboard.
- Batch size and loss function choice impact AOT performance.
