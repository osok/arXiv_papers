# SUMMARY
The paper presents a diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D scenes from single 2D images, addressing the challenge of unseen parts. The approach integrates differentiable forward models with conditional diffusion models, validated on three computer vision tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Constructing a 3D scene from a single 2D image is complex due to hidden parts.
- Previous data completion methods struggle with 3D scene completion.
- A diffusion-based framework can generate multiple realistic 3D scenes from a 2D image.
- The framework uses differentiable forward models and conditional diffusion models.
- The model is trained end-to-end, eliminating the need for a two-step process.
- The model directly produces a variety of samples of the signal of interest.
- The approach is validated on inverse graphics, single image motion prediction, and GAN inversion.
- The method assumes access to a differentiable implementation of the forward model.
- Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are generative models that learn to sample from a distribution by denoising samples.
- Existing DDPMs can't be trained if signals are not available.
- The new class of denoising diffusion models represents a distribution of signals based on a given observation.
- The model integrates a differentiable forward model into the iterative conditional denoising process.
- The model is trained using pairs of context and target observations of the same signal.
- The model asymptotically learns the true conditional distribution over signals.
- Variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, and neural processes have limitations in modeling complex signal distributions.
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown promising results in unconditional generative modeling.
- Diffusion models trained directly on signals have been effective for various inverse problems.
- The framework is applied to inverse graphics, single image motion prediction, and GAN inversion.
- Inverse graphics involves generating samples from the distribution of possible 3D scenes from a single image.
- Single image motion prediction involves predicting all plausible pixel movements in an image.
- GAN inversion involves projecting partial images onto the latent space of StyleGAN2.
- The model uses a warping operator to implement a forward model for motion prediction.
- The model employs a 2D network to generate the motion map for single image motion prediction.
- The model uses a denoising network to estimate the StyleGAN latent code from small patches for GAN inversion.
- The method outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic 3D scene completion methods.
- The method generates diverse samples that match the input patch for GAN inversion.
