# SUMMARY
The text compares Laura and full fine-tuning for LLaMA models in code and math domains, analyzing performance, forgetting, and regularization effects.

# IDEAS:
- Laura falls short in code tasks compared to full fine-tuning but narrows the gap in math tasks.
- Instruction fine-tuning involves question-answer datasets with tens to hundreds of millions of tokens.
- Continued pre-training entails training on billions of unlabeled tokens.
- Laura better preserves source domain performance than full fine-tuning.
- Laura and full fine-tuning exhibit a similar trade-off curve between learning and forgetting.
- Laura offers stronger regularization compared to traditional methods like dropout and weight decay.
- Full fine-tuning induces high-rank perturbations to the base model's weight matrices.
- Laura's performance is highly influenced by learning rates and the selection of target modules.
- Laura can save memory and enable efficient multi-tenant serving by sharing a base model across users.
- Instruction fine-tuning leads to more significant improvements compared to continued pre-training in coding tasks.
- Laura shows improvements in math tasks but remains less sample efficient compared to full fine-tuning.
- Laura forgets less than full fine-tuning, especially in programming tasks.
- Laura helps maintain diversity in token generations during text generation tasks.
- Full fine-tuning does not necessarily learn low-rank perturbations.
- The rank of perturbations increases with more training data and varies across module types and layers.
- The best learning rates for Laura are 5e-4 for code and 2e-4 for math.
- Targeting all modules yielded better results compared to MLP and attention modules.
- Selecting a relatively low rank such as r=16 while targeting all modules strikes a good balance.
- Continual learning on a new domain may lead to a trade-off in performance on the original domain.
- Replaying source domain data during continual learning can help mitigate forgetting.
