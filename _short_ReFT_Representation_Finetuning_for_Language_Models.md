# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the development and application of ref methods for model interpretability, focusing on low-rank linear subspaces in neural network representations.

# IDEAS:
- Ref methods are motivated by intervention-based model interpretability and a linear representation hypothesis.
- These methods are grounded in the concept of linear subspaces within neural network representations.
- The low-rank linear Subspace ref (low reft) method enables targeted modifications to model representations.
- Low reft allows efficient adjustments without full fine-tuning, enhancing model adaptability to tasks.
- Low reft employs a variant of the distributed interchange intervention operation to edit model representations.
- By focusing on specific subspaces, low reft offers precise control over model behavior.
- Parameters like low-rank matrix projection, linear projection, and bias vector are optimized in low reft.
- Optimization leads to improved performance in generating task-specific outputs while maintaining parameter efficiency.
- Generalization of low reft to a family of reft methods allows interventions on hidden representations.
- Interventions with non-overlapping and independent parameters offer flexibility across different layers and tasks.
- Ref methods expand utility across a wide range of scenarios and model architectures.
- Linear subspaces provide a theoretical foundation for the design and implementation of ref methods.
- Low reft enhances performance across various tasks by aligning representations with desired values.
- The approach allows for precise control over model behavior through targeted modifications.
- Low-dimensional subspaces are used to edit model representations efficiently.
- The method enhances performance in language modeling and classification tasks.
- Ref methods allow for interventions during the model forward pass.
- Non-overlapping parameters in interventions provide targeted modifications across different layers.
- The family of reft methods offers flexibility in modifying hidden representations.
