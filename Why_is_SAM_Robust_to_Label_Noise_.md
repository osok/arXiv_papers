# SUMMARY
The section explores Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in deep networks, highlighting its robustness to label noise compared to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

# IDEAS:
- SAM excels in handling random label noise, outperforming SGD significantly in scenarios with 30% label noise.
- 1SAM applies perturbations to each sample individually in a mini-batch, enhancing label noise robustness.
- Test accuracy peaks midway in the presence of random label noise, not necessarily improving with prolonged training.
- SAM's effectiveness lies in its early learning phase rather than sharpness at convergence.
- SAM remains robust even with fewer parameters and its advantages increase with more data.
- SAM prioritizes gradient contributions of low-loss points, beneficial for mislabeled examples.
- Upweighting gradients for low-loss examples helps prevent overfitting to noisy data.
- SAM's perturbations on the logit scale are minimal while focusing on the network Jacobian term.
- Jacobian-only SAM approach simplifies to SGD with L2 regularization on final layer weights.
- SAM's resilience to label noise primarily stems from its Jacobian term in nonlinear scenarios.
- SAM's effectiveness against label noise may arise from the optimization path followed.
- Logistic loss function for binary classification uses the sigmoid function to find gradient with respect to model parameters.
- 1SAM computes adversarial perturbation for each example individually, leading to improved performance.
- J-SAM performs similarly to 1SAM in deep networks, while L-SAM does not show the same improvement.
- SAM enhances gradients of low-loss examples through the logit scale term in linear models.
- SAM favors upweighting gradients of clean points, leading to higher early stopping test accuracy.
- Applying SAM perturbation solely to the logit scale component does not explain SAM's gains.
- J-SAM largely recovers the gains of 1SAM, indicating Jacobian term's significance in robustness.
- Regularization effect on intermediate activations and last layer weights observed in deeper networks using J-SAM.
- Regularized SGD does not match test accuracy achieved by SAM but narrows the performance gap.
- Implicit bias of SAM impacts network training and generalization, emphasizing per-example regularization.
