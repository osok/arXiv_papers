# SUMMARY
The Phased Consistency Model (PCM) addresses limitations in latent consistency models (LCMs) by improving consistency, controllability, and efficiency in image and video generation.

# IDEAS:

- PCM improves stability, controllability, and efficiency in image generation compared to traditional LCMs.
- PCM splits the trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories with defined edge time steps.
- Each sub-trajectory is treated as an independent consistency model.
- The consistency function ensures outputs are consistent for arbitrary pairs on the same sub-trajectory.
- Boundary conditions are crucial for successful training and are explicitly parameterized.
- PCM introduces a phased consistency distillation objective to bound solution estimation error.
- Deterministic sampling follows the transition definition within the same sub-trajectory.
- PCM introduces an adversarial consistency loss to enforce distribution consistency.
- Adversarial loss penalizes distribution distance between sampled points and predicted solution points.
