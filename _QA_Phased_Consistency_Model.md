# SUMMARY
The Phased Consistency Model (PCM) addresses limitations in latent consistency models (LCMs) by improving consistency, controllability, and efficiency in image and video generation.

# IDEAS:
- PCM phases the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories, enforcing self-consistency on each for deterministic sampling.
- PCM improves stability, controllability, and efficiency in image generation compared to traditional LCMs.
- PCM splits the trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories with defined edge time steps.
- Each sub-trajectory is treated as an independent consistency model.
- The consistency function ensures outputs are consistent for arbitrary pairs on the same sub-trajectory.
- Boundary conditions are crucial for successful training and are satisfied by parameterizing the consistency function.
- PCM introduces a phased consistency distillation objective, discretizing the trajectory into sub-intervals.
- Solution estimation error within and across sub-trajectories is bounded.
- Deterministic sampling follows the transition definition from one time step to another within the same sub-trajectory.
