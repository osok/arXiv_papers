# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the primary bottleneck in autoregressive decoding of large language models (LLMs), focusing on memory read/write operations. It introduces speculative decoding (SD) and the Kangaroo framework to address these challenges.

# IDEAS:
- Memory read/write operations of model weights are the primary bottleneck in LLM autoregressive decoding.
- Arithmetic computations are not the main latency issue in LLM autoregressive decoding.
- Decoding with Funia 33B on four Nvidia V100 GPUs yields only seven new tokens per second.
- Speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate autoregressive decoding by verifying multiple tokens in parallel.
- The effectiveness of SD relies on the gap between the draft model and the target LLM.
- The inference latency of the draft model is crucial for SD effectiveness.
- Training a tiny draft model from scratch can be costly, limiting real-world application.
- SD can generate one to gamma plus one new tokens within each forward pass of the large LLM.
- The end-to-end speedup ratio is proportional to the consistent token acceptance rate.
- Self-rating methods like LLMA and REST generate draft tokens by selecting text bans or retrieving relevant tokens.
- Kangaroo framework introduces an autoregressive self-drafted lightweight adapter module on a fixed shallow subnetwork.
- Kangaroo offers a low-cost way to train a lightweight small model and achieve speedups on SPEC Bench.
- Kangaroo outperforms other methods with fewer additional parameters.
- The efficiency of Kangaroo's adapter network is highlighted by its simple yet powerful design.
- Kangaroo's adapter network has only 11.3% of the parameters of Medusa's heads.
- Cross entropy loss exhibits a faster convergence rate than maximizing token acceptance rate.
- The training approach for the adapter network involves using cross entropy loss for faster convergence.
- Kangaroo achieves speedups up to 1.7 times, outperforming Medusa with 88.7% fewer additional parameters.
- Kangaroo introduces an early exiting mechanism for generating draft tokens, reducing computational costs.
- The adapter network in Kangaroo consists of one multi-head attention and two normalization layers.
