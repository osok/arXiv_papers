# SUMMARY
The paper explores deep learning models' decision-making processes, focusing on Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to understand model behavior, consistency, entanglement, and spatial dependence.

# IDEAS:
- Deep learning models can outperform human experts but are complex to understand.
- Model explanations come in various forms like input features, prototypes, or concepts.
- Low-level feature methods face issues like confirmation bias and lack of faithfulness.
- Concept-based approaches offer explanations using familiar high-level terms.
- Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) represent a concept in the activation space of a specific layer.
- CAVs use a probe data set of concept examples for representation.
- Concept-based methods face challenges like sensitivity to specific probe data sets.
- The paper focuses on three key properties of concept vectors: inconsistency, entanglement, and spatial dependence.
- Tools are provided to analyze each property and their impact on testing with CAVs.
- Creating CAVs for multiple layers can help confirm expected dependencies between related concepts.
- Visualizing spatial dependence can aid in understanding model behavior.
- A modified version of CAVs can identify translation invariance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- A customizable synthetic data set called Elements was developed for further exploration.
- Elements data set helps investigate the faithfulness of concept-based explanations.
- CAVs involve mapping input to a vector in the activation space and then to the output.
- Testing with CAVs (TCAV) evaluates model's conceptual sensitivity across a class.
- The study focuses on three hypotheses related to CAVs for insights into network representations.
- Consistency across layers means the effect of a concept vector remains the same across different layers.
- Entangled concepts are CAVs that encode multiple concepts simultaneously.
- Spatial dependence considers data sets containing the same concept but in different locations.
- Linear perturbations are introduced to determine if concept vectors have the same influence on activations.
- Consistency error measures how consistent the vectors are when projected into the next layer.
- Optimized CAVs have a lower error compared to random CAVs, suggesting standard approaches may not find optimal vectors.
- Entangled concept vectors can impact TCAV scores, leading to potentially misleading explanations.
- Spatially dependent CAVs show how regions contribute most to the TCAV score.
- Model sensitivity to concepts varies based on their location in the input image.
- Visualizing concept vector spatial dependence helps understand how concepts interact in the model.
