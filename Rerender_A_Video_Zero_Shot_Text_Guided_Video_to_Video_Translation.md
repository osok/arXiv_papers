- A novel zero-shot framework for text-guided video-to-video translation is presented.
- The framework combines hierarchical cross-frame constraints and hybrid diffusion-based generation with patch-based propagation.
- Previous works on text-driven image generation used GANs and auto-regressive models like DALL-E and CogView.
- Recent studies focus on diffusion models for text-to-image generation.

- Zero-shot methods operate without a training phase and are compatible with pre-trained diffusion variants.
- Cross-frame attention and early-stage fusion enhance temporal consistency but struggle with texture and detail consistency.
- The proposed method achieves pixel-level temporal consistency through pixel-aware cross-frame latent fusion.
- Stable diffusion operates in the latent space of an autoencoder with a forward and backward diffusion process.
- ControlNet provides precise spatial control over the outcome by accepting additional conditions like edges and depth.
