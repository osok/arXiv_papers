# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the design of CoT prompts and data engineering using Python, focusing on reinforcement learning to improve math problem-solving performance.

# IDEAS:
- CoT prompts are designed for step-by-step reasoning solutions in Python.
- Previous research aimed to make CoT comprehensive and fine-grained.
- Significant improvements were observed over natural language CoT.
- Generated code verifies intermediate reasoning steps with GPT-4.
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance on GSM8K and math datasets.
- Explored proximal policy optimization (PPO) for aligning human preferences.
- Proposed training algorithms include DPO, IPO, and KTO.
- Adopted reinforcement learning as a fine-tuning paradigm.
- Trained outcome-based or process-based reward models for reranking.
- Reinforced fine-tuning (ReF) process consists of warm-up and reinforcement learning stages.
- Warm-up stage involves fine-tuning policy on question CoT titles.
- CoT generation is decomposed into next token prediction actions.
- Reinforcement learning stage uses online self-learning for improvement.
- Employed PPO with a clipped objective algorithm for training.
- Constructed a value model to evaluate response correctness.
- Conducted experiments on three math problem datasets: GSM8K, MATH, and MathQA.
- GSM8K and MATH use numeric answers; MathQA uses multiple-choice lists.
- Performed few-shot prompting using GPT-3.5 Turbo for annotations.
- Compared ReF with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and self-training baselines.
- Implemented offline and online self-training methods for fair comparison.
- Offline self-training involves supervised fine-tuning on original data and expert samples.
- Online self-training is comparable to ReF with continual training using generated samples.

# INSIGHTS:
