# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss the increasing role of generative AI in daily life, focusing on enhancing text-to-audio models using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align audio outputs with human preferences. They introduce Tango 2, which outperforms previous models, and share the Audio Alpaca dataset.

# IDEAS:
- Generative AI's presence is growing in daily life through models like ChatGPT and GP4.
- Demand for AI-generated content is rising in multimedia industries.
- Effective text-to-audio models are essential for quick audiovisual content creation.
- Supervised fine-tuning based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is cost-effective.
- DPO is an alternative to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).
- Tango model uses a latent diffusion model (LDM) and an instruction-tuned LLM.
- Tango's components include a textual prompt encoder, LDM, and audio VAE with vocoder.
- Textual prompt encoder uses pre-trained LLM Flon T5 Large for text encoding.
- Latent diffusion model constructs audio prior guided by text encoding.
- Audio VAE compresses Mel spectrogram into audio prior, reconstructed using text guidance.
- Hi-Fi Gon vocoder converts Mel spectrogram into final audio output.
- Data augmentation merges two audio signals considering human auditory perception.
- Audio Alpaca dataset contains diverse audio descriptions paired with preferred and undesirable audios.
- Preferred audios reflect text descriptions; undesirable audios have flaws like high noise.
- Adversarial filtering selects audios with low CLAP scores for undesirable audios.
- Fine-tuning Tango on pruned Audio Alpaca dataset results in Tango 2.
- Tango 2 outperforms Tango and AUD LM2 in objective and human evaluations.
- Preference optimization involves supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and RL optimization.
- Bradley-Terry model helps in learning human preference distribution.
- Audio Alpaca dataset created using strategies like multiple inferences and perturbed prompts.
- Temporal perturbations involve changing event order or adding/removing events in prompts.
- CLAP matching scores select winning and losing audio samples based on alignment with text prompts.
- DPO allows learning from both desirable and undesirable outputs.
- DPO objective derived by replacing optimal reward from RLHF in negative log likelihood loss.
- Tango 2 fine-tuned using AdamW optimizer with specific learning rate and scheduler.
- Objective metrics like FAD, KL Divergence, IS, and CLAP score assess text-to-audio generation quality.
- Subjective evaluation focuses on overall audio quality and relevance to text input.
- Ablation study explores impact of different ways of creating negative data on performance.

# INSIGHTS:
