# SUMMARY
The text discusses the efficiency challenges of Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and introduces "trajectory stitching" (t-stitch) to enhance performance by dynamically allocating computational resources.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) create high-quality outputs but require computationally expensive sampling steps.
- Generating eight images with a DPM on an RTX 3090 takes about 16.5 seconds.
- Smaller DPMs like DS are faster but produce lower quality images compared to larger models like D XL.
- Efficiency improvements focus on reducing computational cost per step and decreasing the number of sampling steps.
- Techniques like model compression, quantization, and pruning help reduce computational costs.
- Condensing multiple denoising steps or enhancing differential equation solvers can decrease sampling steps.
- Using the same model for all denoising steps is inefficient due to unique characteristics of each step.
- Trajectory stitching (t-stitch) dynamically allocates computational resources to different denoising steps.
- T-stitch starts with a smaller DPM and switches to a larger DPM for later steps.
- Using two models, DS and D XL, can speed up inference without compromising quality.
- T-stitch achieves a 1.5 times speedup by using DS for the first 40% of steps.
- Different DPMs trained on the same data distribution share similar sampling trajectories.
- Smaller models generate good global structure in initial steps, while larger models capture high-frequency details later.
- T-stitch improves inference speed without noticeable loss in generation quality across various architectures.
- T-stitch enhances prompt alignment for stylized models in text-to-image generation.
- T-stitch is complementary to existing fast sampling methods and can benefit from other efficiency techniques.
- Fine-tuning stitched DPMs based on trajectory schedules can further enhance generation quality.
- T-stitch allows for significant speedups without sacrificing quality in large DPMs like stable diffusion.
- T-stitch is broadly applicable across different model architectures and samplers.
- T-stitch leverages pre-trained smaller DPMs for early denoising steps, leaving larger DPMs for later steps.
- Stitchable neural networks (SN net) involve splitting and stitching pre-trained models of different sizes.
- T-stitch differs from SN net by directly applying models of varying sizes without additional training.
- Classifier-free guidance trains conditional and unconditional models within the same network for better generation quality.
- T-stitch can be applied to various architectures like UNet and stable diffusion models.
- Smaller models handle initial denoising steps effectively, reserving fine details for larger models.
- T-stitch achieves significant speedups with minimal impact on image quality in experiments with UNet and stable diffusion models.
- T-stitch is compatible with advanced samplers, further enhancing generation quality in fewer time steps.
