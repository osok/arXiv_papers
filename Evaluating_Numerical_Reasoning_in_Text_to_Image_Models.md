- The benchmark assesses exact number generation, approximate number generation, and reasoning about partial quantities.
- Seven models from three families were evaluated using GECKNUM.
- Human feedback determines if generated images align with numerical prompts.
- Models perform better when numbers are represented as words rather than digits.
- Complex prompts with spatial relationships or multiple number-noun combinations reduce model accuracy.
- Task three, involving conceptual quantitative reasoning, is the most challenging for models.
- High inter-annotator agreement was observed in human annotations.
- Models tend to overestimate numbers, showing more entities than specified.
