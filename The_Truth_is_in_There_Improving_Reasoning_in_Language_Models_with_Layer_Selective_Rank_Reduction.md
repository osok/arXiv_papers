- Careful pruning at specific layers can significantly improve performance on certain tasks.
- Layer Selective Rank Reduction (LASER) removes higher-order components of weight matrices.
- LASER improves accuracy in natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning tasks.
- LASER acts as a denoising procedure, making weakly learned facts more accessible.
- LASER increases robustness to paraphrases on previously correct questions.
- Higher-order components introduce noise in decision-making, conflicting with low-order components.
- Removing higher-order components can lead to correct answers becoming accessible.
- Transformer architecture involves self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks.
- Pruning methods can significantly reduce model size without sacrificing much accuracy.
- Selectively pruning certain layers can improve model performance without additional training.
- Rank approximation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) helps in matrix reduction.
- LASER involves parameters for matrix type, layer number, and rank fraction.
- GPT-J model's performance improves with rank reduction in MLP layers.
- Rank reduction increases model's accuracy on factual knowledge and robustness to paraphrases.
- Higher-order components often capture incorrect responses of the correct type.
