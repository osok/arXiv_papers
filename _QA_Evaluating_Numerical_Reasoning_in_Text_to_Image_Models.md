# SUMMARY
GE KO aims to evaluate numerical reasoning in text-to-image models through a comprehensive benchmark, addressing gaps in existing evaluations.

# IDEAS:
- GE KO addresses the gap in evaluating numerical reasoning in text-to-image models.
- It provides a comprehensive and controlled benchmark for numerical reasoning.
- The benchmark focuses on exact number generation, approximate number generation, and reasoning about partial quantities.
- GE KO includes 1386 text prompts, 52721 generated images, and 47957 human annotations.
- Task one evaluates a model's ability to generate an exact number of objects.
- Task two assesses models on depicting entities with quantities expressed in approximate terms.
- Task three evaluates models on conceptual understanding of objects, parts, proportions, and fractions.
- Human annotations are collected to measure if images accurately match the prompts.
- Participants count objects, select descriptions, and answer questions related to the prompt words.
- The method processes annotations to calculate model accuracy based on agreement with ground truth.
- GE KO's design allows for a robust evaluation of numerical reasoning in text-to-image models.
- Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of numerical reasoning due to limited prompts with numbers.
- GE KO offers a vast dataset covering various dimensions of numerical reasoning.
- It evaluates models on a wide range of numerical tasks, providing nuanced understanding of strengths and weaknesses.
- GE KO's diverse prompt types and templates enable thorough evaluation of models.
- The evaluation process involves generating images for seven models from three different families.
- Human annotations ensure consistency in the evaluation process with high interannotator agreement.
- Task one was the easiest for all models, with DALL-E3 outperforming others.
- Task two showed models struggled with understanding linguistic quantifiers like "no."
- Task three was the hardest, with most models performing close to or below baseline.
- Limitations include complexity of prompts, lack of clear ground truth, and model performance variability.
- GE KO may not generalize to all text-to-image models or real-world scenarios.
- Some prompts require a combination of different reasoning skills beyond numerical reasoning.
- Scalability to accommodate larger datasets may be limited.
- Human annotation variability can introduce noise and uncertainty in evaluation results.
- Certain models may perform better or worse on specific types of prompts within GE KO.
