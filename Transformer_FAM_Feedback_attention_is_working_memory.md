- Transformers have replaced LSTM in NLP tasks and CNN in vision tasks with models like Vision Transformer (ViT).
- Attention is key for extracting meaningful information, leading to advancements in multimodal fusion.
- Models like DALL-E and Flamingo combine text and vision, while AudioLM and Gemini integrate text, images, audio, and video.
- Attention has limitations like quadratic complexity with context length, challenging long context modeling.
- Sliding window attention handles infinitely long sequences but has limitations in capturing information beyond a certain window size.
- Sparse attention and linear approximated attention address long context problems but may not scale well.
- Neuroscience links attention to multisensory integration and working memory in the brain.

- Transformer FAM maintains past information indefinitely, promising for handling infinitely long input sequences.
- Transformer FAM does not introduce new weights, allowing reuse of pre-trained checkpoints.
- Fine-tuning Transformer FAM with LoRA improves performance on long context tasks across different scales of LLMs.
- Block sliding window attention (BSWA) caches information on a block-by-block basis without masking past keys and values.
- BSWA has two key parameters: block size and memory segment, determining tokens per block and past blocks to cache.
- Transformer FAM integrates feedback activations into each block of BSWA for richer representations and dynamic propagation.
- FAM query compresses the current block based on previous global contextual information, optimizing utilization.
- Transformer FAM maintains memory efficiency and training speed similar to BSWA despite additional considerations.
- Ideal data for training Transformer FAM includes long documents with continuous context like textbooks or novels.
- The curse of IID challenges suitable training infrastructure or data for memory training.
- Transformer FAM outperformed BSWA on various long context tasks, showcasing its ability to compress and retain crucial contextual information.
- Performance on tasks saturated when FAM length reached 64, indicating limited space is more effective for compressing information.
