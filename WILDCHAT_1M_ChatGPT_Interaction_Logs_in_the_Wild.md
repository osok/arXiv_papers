# SUMMARY
The section discusses the development and analysis of conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on the WLDChat dataset, which includes 1 million multilingual conversations.

# IDEAS:
- Conversational agents powered by LLMs are used in customer service and personal assistance.
- Examples include OpenAI's ChatGPT, GPT-4, Anthropic's Cloud 2 and 3, Google's Bard, and Microsoft's Bing Chat.
- Development involves pre-training, fine-tuning on instruction tuning datasets, and optionally using reinforcement learning from human feedback.
- Instruction tuning datasets are often private, creating barriers for researchers.
- Existing datasets mainly fall into natural use cases and expert-curated collections.
- Natural use cases involving real user interactions are usually not publicly available.
- The WLDChat dataset includes 1 million multilingual conversations with over 2.5 million interaction terms.
- Data was collected via ChatGPT and GPT-4 APIs with explicit user consent.
- The dataset includes demographic information for detailed behavioral analysis.
- WLDChat reveals a high level of toxicity in interactions, highlighting the need for intervention.
- Fine-tuning chatbots on the raw dataset can produce strong chatbots.
- WLDChat consists of 1,924,245 complete conversations from 20,473 unique IP addresses.
- 24% of conversations use GPT-4 API, while 76% use GPT-3.5 Turbo API.
- Most data comes from users in the United States, Russia, and China.
- Common prompt categories include creative writing, analysis, decision explanation, and coding.
- WLDChat includes 68 languages, with English being the most common.
- WLDChat and LMSYChat1M stand out for having authentic user prompts from real interactions.
- WLDChat provides longer user prompts and chatbot responses compared to other datasets.
- WLDChat showed higher toxicity ratios compared to other datasets.
- Toxicity levels in chatbot interactions decreased after a June update to the OpenAI model.
- Jailbreaking behaviors involve users manipulating chatbots into producing inappropriate responses.
- The prompt "jail mommy" had a success rate of 71.6% in jailbreaking attempts.
- Fine-tuning a LLaMA model using WLDChat data produced a new model called WildLLaMA.
- WildLLaMA outperformed other open-source models but fell short compared to proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- Anonymity provided by chatbots could lead to a selection bias towards more toxic content.
- More data is useful but not always essential; high-quality examples can align models with human preferences.
- Ethical considerations include removing personally identifiable information to safeguard user privacy.

# INSIGHTS:
- Instruction tuning datasets' privacy creates barriers for research progress in conversational agents.
- Real-world user interactions are crucial for training better chatbots and improving user modeling.
- High levels of toxicity in chatbot interactions highlight the need for intervention strategies.
- Fine-tuning on real-world data can significantly enhance chatbot performance.
- Jailbreaking behaviors necessitate adaptive defense mechanisms to counter evolving tactics.
- Ethical data collection practices are essential to protect user privacy in chatbot interactions.
