# SUMMARY
The authors discuss challenges in decoding from large autoregressive models and propose speculative decoding to accelerate inference without changing model architectures, training procedures, or output distributions.

# IDEAS:
- Large autoregressive models like GPT-3 and PaLM are more capable but slower in decoding.
- Decoding from large models requires multiple serial runs, increasing time complexity.
- Strategies to speed up inference include reducing inference cost and adaptive computation methods.
- Adaptive computation methods use fewer resources for easier inference steps.
- Speculative execution increases concurrency by performing tasks in parallel.
- Speculative execution is extended to stochastic settings for autoregressive models.
- Speculative sampling maximizes the probability of speculative tasks being accepted.
- The method ensures outputs have the same distribution as the target model.
- Speculative decoding can generate multiple tokens per run, improving efficiency.
- The method achieves significant latency improvements without changing outputs.
- Standardized sampling methods can be simplified into standard sampling from adjusted distributions.
- Speculative sampling involves accepting or rejecting samples based on probability ratios.
- The acceptance rate measures how well the approximation model matches the target model.
- The expected number of tokens generated depends on the acceptance rate.
- Wall time improvement relies on having sufficient computational resources for concurrency.
- The cost coefficient represents the time ratio between approximation and target models.
- The method reduces memory accesses by reading target model weights once per execution.
- Choosing the optimal gamma value maximizes processing time improvement.
- Approximation models significantly smaller than target models yield high alpha values.
- Empirical results show speedups of up to 3.4 times for translation tasks.
- Speculative decoding is easy to implement and doesn't require retraining models.

# INSIGHTS:
- Large autoregressive models' decoding is often limited by memory bandwidth, not arithmetic operations.
- Speculative execution increases concurrency, enhancing inference speed without altering outputs.
- Speculative sampling ensures outputs match the target model's distribution while improving efficiency.
- The acceptance rate is crucial for determining the efficiency of speculative sampling.
- Wall time improvement depends on balancing computational resources and concurrency.
- Approximation models significantly smaller than target models can still yield high efficiency gains.
- Speculative decoding offers substantial speedups without changing model architectures or retraining.
- The method's simplicity makes it suitable for production settings with available compute resources.
- Speculative execution can be applied beyond autoregressive models, such as in physics simulations.
