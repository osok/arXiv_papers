# SUMMARY
The authors discuss challenges in decoding large autoregressive models and propose speculative decoding to accelerate inference without altering model architectures, training, or outputs.

# IDEAS:
- Large autoregressive models like GPT-3 and PaLM are more capable but slower in decoding.
- Decoding from large models requires multiple serial runs, increasing time complexity.
- Strategies to speed up inference include reducing cost for all inputs or using adaptive computation.
- Adaptive computation methods use fewer resources for easier inference steps but require model changes.
- Speculative execution increases concurrency by performing tasks in parallel to checking their necessity.
- Speculative execution is extended to stochastic settings, sampling from efficient models as speculative prefixes.
- Speculative sampling maximizes the probability of speculative tasks being accepted while maintaining output distribution.
- The method achieves significant latency improvements without changing model outputs.
- Standardized sampling methods can be simplified into standard sampling from adjusted probability distributions.
- Speculative sampling involves accepting or rejecting samples based on probability ratios between distributions.
- The reduction factor in serial calls to the target model depends on the acceptance rate of speculative samples.
- The acceptance rate is derived from the divergence between distributions of the target and approximation models.
- Wall time improvement relies on having sufficient computational resources for increased concurrency.
- The expected improvement factor in wall time is calculated based on the cost coefficient and acceptance rate.
- The number of arithmetic operations may increase with speculative execution, depending on acceptance rates.
- Memory accesses can decrease with speculative execution, reducing the number of reads for model weights and caches.
- Choosing the optimal gamma value maximizes processing time improvement based on cost coefficient and acceptance rate.
- Approximation models significantly smaller than the target model tend to produce high acceptance rates.
- Empirical results show speedups of up to 3.4 times for translation tasks using smaller approximation models.
- Speculative sampling enables efficient stochastic speculative execution for autoregressive models.
- The method provides meaningful speedups without changing model architecture or requiring retraining.
- Speculative decoding can be applied to other domains like images and physics simulations.

# INSIGHTS:
