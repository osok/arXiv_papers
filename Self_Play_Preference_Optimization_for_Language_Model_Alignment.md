- Human preferences are complex and may not follow a consistent hierarchy.
- Researchers propose algorithms that better represent human preferences using preference probabilities.
- Some RHF methods treat the problem as a two-player game to find the Nash equilibrium.
- The self-play preference optimization (SPO) algorithm aims to solve the two-player game efficiently.
- SPO converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium with a simple loss function for optimization.
- SPO outperforms other approaches on various benchmarks without external supervision.
- RHF initially involved learning a reward model based on human preferences.
- Direct policy optimization (DPO) and rejection sampling optimization (RSO) improve RHF efficiency and stability.
- General preference models maximize the probability of a policy's response being preferred over another.
- Self-play fine-tuning iteratively improves policies based on generated data from previous rounds.
- Theoretical analyses provide guarantees and insights into RHF methods.
- The Bradley Terry model specifies the probability of one response being chosen over another.
- SPO uses a multiplicative weight update to converge towards the optimal policy.
- SPO addresses data scarcity issues better than IPO by comparing responses in the dataset.
- Pair RM, a pairwise preference model, outperforms many language model-based reward models.
- Pair RM provides relative rewards that capture preference strength during response generation.
- Experiments use Nvidia A100 GPUs with hyperparameters tuned based on win rate metrics.
- SPO models consistently improve performance across iterations and outperform DPO and IPO.
- SPO achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art AI chatbots on specific tasks.
- The alignment tax phenomenon may cause performance decline in subsequent alignment iterations.
- Improving language model capabilities through alignment iterations is a topic for future research.
