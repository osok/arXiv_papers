# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "positional Skip Wise pose fine-tuning" to extend the context window of large language models (LLMs) efficiently, maintaining performance and memory efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs are limited by a preset context window size, affecting performance on long input sequences.
- Fine-tuning LLMs on longer inputs introduces disruption due to new position indices.
- Downscaling position indices to match the original window size shows some improvement.
- Positional Skip Wise pose fine-tuning separates fine-tuning length from target context window length.
- Pose simulates long inputs by manipulating position indices within a fixed context window.
- Pose divides the original context window into chunks, adjusting position indices with a skipping bias term.
- Pose is memory and time efficient, requiring only the original context size for fine-tuning.
- Pose extends the context window of LLMs by up to 64 times while maintaining performance.
- Pose is compatible with all rope-based LLMs and Pi strategies.
- Pose can theoretically extend the context window to an infinite length, constrained only by memory usage.
- Length extrapolation ensures model performance even when input tokens exceed the trained context window size.
- Memory mechanisms like recurrence-based and retrieval-based approaches handle long input sequences.
- Rotary position embedding (rope) encodes position information using a rotation matrix.
- Rope operates on query and key vectors at each layer, allowing relative position dependency.
- Position interpolation scales down position indices to align with the original context window size.
- Linear interpolation scales down the position index to improve stability during fine-tuning.
- Neural tangent kernel (NTK) interpolation alters the rotational speed of each dimension of rope.
- Yarn interpolation combines linear and NTK interpolation across different dimensions.
- Pose avoids out-of-distribution positions during inference by covering the range from one to the target length.
- Pose maintains the structure of manipulated position indices close to the original structure.
- Pose resamples chunk lengths and skipping bias terms for each training example.
- Pose achieves impressive results on context lengths of 16k and 32k for language modeling and pasy retrieval.
- Pose outperforms Rand PA by preserving pre-trained language modeling ability.
- All scaling methods experience performance degradation as supported context length increases.
- Pose extended models maintain high retrieval accuracy within their target context window.
- Pose requires significantly lower memory and time consumption compared to full-length fine-tuning.
- Pose exhibits close language modeling ability to full-length fine-tuning with a smaller training context size.
- Pose works well across different rope-based models and interpolation strategies.
- NTK and yarn interpolation generally give better results than linear interpolation.
- Pose can potentially extend language models to support infinite input lengths.
- Pose successfully extends the model's context window to 96k and 128k with linear and yarn interpolation.
- Pose extended models show slight performance drops compared to full-length fine-tuning on standard benchmarks.
