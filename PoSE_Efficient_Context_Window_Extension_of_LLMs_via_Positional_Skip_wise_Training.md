# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Positional Skip Wise (POSE) fine-tuning to extend the context window of large language models (LLMs) efficiently, maintaining performance.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs are limited by a preset context window size, affecting performance on long input sequences.
- Fine-tuning LLMs on longer inputs introduces disruption due to new position indices.
- Downscaling position indices to match the original window size shows some improvement.
- Positional Skip Wise (POSE) fine-tuning separates fine-tuning length from target context window length.
- POSE simulates long inputs by manipulating position indices within a fixed context window.
- POSE divides the original context window into chunks and adjusts position indices with a skipping bias term.
- POSE is memory and time efficient, avoiding quadratic computational complexity increase.
- POSE extends the context window of LLMs by up to 64 times while maintaining performance.
- POSE is compatible with all ROPE-based LLMs and interpolation strategies.
- POSE can theoretically extend the context window to an infinite length, constrained only by memory usage.
- Rotary Position Embedding (ROPE) encodes position information using a rotation matrix.
- ROPE operates on query and key vectors at each layer, allowing for relative position dependency.
- Position interpolation scales down position indices to align with the original context window size.
- Linear interpolation scales down the position index to improve stability during fine-tuning.
- Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) interpolation alters the rotational speed of each dimension of ROPE.
- Yarn interpolation combines linear and NTK interpolation in different proportions across dimensions.
- POSE avoids out-of-distribution positions during inference by covering the range from one to the target length.
- POSE maintains the structure of manipulated position indices close to the original structure.
- POSE resamples both the length and skipping bias term of every chunk for each training example.
- POSE achieves impressive results on context lengths of 16k and 32k for language modeling and retrieval tasks.
- POSE outperforms other methods like full-length fine-tuning and Rand PA in maintaining performance.
- POSE extended models maintain high retrieval accuracy within their respective target context windows.
- POSE requires significantly lower memory and time consumption compared to full-length fine-tuning.
- POSE works well across different ROPE-based models and interpolation strategies.
- NTK and Yarn interpolation generally give better results than linear interpolation.
- POSE can potentially extend language models to support infinite input lengths.
- POSE extended models show slight performance drop compared to full-length fine-tuning on standard benchmarks.
