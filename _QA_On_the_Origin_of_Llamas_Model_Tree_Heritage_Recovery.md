# SUMMARY
The proposed mother recovery method aims to map the structure of model graphs, recovering relationships between models based on their weights.

# IDEAS:
- Mother recovery maps the structure of model graphs, recovering relationships between models based on weights.
- The method clusters nodes into components and reconstructs each model tree's structure.
- It starts by computing weight distance and binary directional matrices from model weights.
- A binary matrix combines weight distance and directional scores for tree recovery.
- A minimum directed spanning tree algorithm recovers the model tree from the combined matrix.
- Additional clustering is needed if models come from different trees before running the algorithm.
- Evaluated on datasets like VTHR and ecosystems like LLaMA 2, it shows high accuracy.
- Theoretical benefits include establishing model lineage and resolving legal disputes over authorship.
- Practical benefits include identifying fine-tuned models and determining relationships based on weight outliers.
- Model trees and graphs help visualize hereditary relations, aiding in clustering and ecosystem recovery.
- They scale up to web-scale model graphs like Hugging Face, enabling detailed hierarchy recovery.
- Edge direction is estimated using a statistic of weights evolving monotonically during training.
- The directional weight score is based on the kurtosis of model weights.
- The score indicates whether one model was trained from another or vice versa.
- The training process is categorized into generalization and specialization stages.
- The directional score is monotonic, increasing during generalization and decreasing during specialization.
- Testing on VTHR showed perfect accuracy for full fine-tuning model trees in three out of five cases.
- For LoRA fine-tuning, all model trees were reconstructed perfectly with varying ranks.
- Slight accuracy reduction occurred when all models used the same rank in one out of five cases.
- Mother recovered the entire model graph with 0.89 accuracy on VTHR.
- Testing on Hugging Face's LLaMA family showed perfect reconstruction of the model tree structure.
- Stable Diffusion family testing had one incorrect edge placement, showing high overall accuracy.
- Robustness testing with identically fine-tuned ViT versions showed correct recovery in all cases.
- Scaling up to web-scale graphs faces challenges in computational resources and distance matrix computation.
- Continuous updating of growing model trees requires new algorithms for efficient weight distance computation.
- Lower-dimensional embedding space projection could reduce computational costs for web-scale graphs.
- Inferring graph properties from metadata adds complexity in data management and analysis.
- Automatically inferring training stages from weights without explicit supervision is challenging.
