- An episodic buffer of past attempts is built to enhance reasoning and future trials.
- The iterative process leads to a 15% increase in problem-solving accuracy after each reflection iteration.
- The model leverages both semantic and episodic knowledge stores to retrieve relevant information.
- Algorithmic concepts are accessed from a competitive programming textbook through semantic retrieval.
- Past experiences are recalled from a bank of USAC problems and solutions via episodic retrieval.
- The model combines retrieved knowledge with the problem description to inform its algorithmic design.
- Insights and designs are grounded in the problem environment for more effective solutions.
- The model engages in self-reflection and retrieval steps until a maximum number of debugging steps is reached.
