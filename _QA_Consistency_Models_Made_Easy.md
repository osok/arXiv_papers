# SUMMARY
The proposed method, Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), aims to improve the training efficiency and scalability of consistency models (CMS) compared to diffusion models.

# IDEAS:
- ECT addresses the time-consuming and challenging training process of consistency models (CMS).
- Traditional CMS require complex hyperparameter choices and substantial training time.
- ECT introduces a differential consistency condition and a streamlined training recipe.
- ECT decreases training costs significantly, making CMS more accessible.
- ECT allows for high-quality sample generation in 1-2 model evaluations.
- ECT competes with state-of-the-art diffusion models using fewer training flops.
- ECT initializes with a pre-trained diffusion model to ensure good targets in the loss objective.
- ECT gradually shrinks time discretization from the largest possible delta T to delta t during training.
- A continuous time training schedule constructs training pairs of R equals z for all T.
- ECT uses a mapping function dependent on training iterations to control delta T.
- The training objective minimizes the distance between model outputs at different noise levels.
- ECT utilizes regular and adaptive weighting functions to control gradient variance across noise levels.
- ECT provides a simple and principled approach to efficiently train CMS.
- ECT results in high-quality sample generation in one or two sampling steps.
- ECT reduces the training cost substantially compared to existing methods like diffusion distillation and ICT.
- ECT allows for a smooth transition from diffusion models to CMS by tightening the consistency condition.
- ECT achieves better two-step sample quality on datasets like CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64x64.
- ECT uses significantly fewer training flops compared to ICT.
- ECT reduces inference cost significantly compared to pre-trained score-based diffusion models.
- ECT addresses the curse of consistency issue when training CMS from scratch.
- ECT ensures stable and efficient training with a loss objective that follows tiny time discretization.
- ECT is validated by comparing CMS trained with ECT against state-of-the-art models.
- Validation metrics include FID and Fréchet Distance under the D2 model.
- Experiments demonstrate ECT's effectiveness in improving efficiency and performance of CMS.
- ECT outperformed ICT by requiring only one-quarter of the training time of ICT.
- ECT reduced inference cost by 1/1000th compared to pre-trained score-based diffusion models.
- On CIFAR10, ECT surpassed consistency distillation with a FID of 2.20 compared to CD's 2.93.
- ECT used around one-third of the training fine-tuning compute of CD.
- ECT achieved better two-step generation performance than state-of-the-art CMS with a modest training budget.
- Limitations include the need for a dataset to tune diffusion models to CMS.
- Data-free approaches for diffusion distillation exist but differ from ECT's self-teacher method.
