# SUMMARY
The paper presents a comprehensive process for image processing and object label prediction using models like ViT, CLIP, and LLaMA.

# IDEAS:
- Image embeddings are obtained using backbone models like ViT and CLIP.
- Token embeddings for object labels are defined using a pre-trained language model.
- Image embeddings and instruction token embeddings are concatenated to form input token embeddings.
- A language decoder projects input token embeddings into the textual space of object label embeddings.
- Object labels are auto-regressively predicted by computing conditional probabilities of each token.
- A non-causal attention mask models interdependence between tokens and spatial correlation of image tokens.
- Cross entropy loss is used for optimization with weakly supervised labels from image captions.
- One-shot sampling generates multiple labels in parallel by sampling tokens for initial tokens.
- The language decoder is truncated to maximize efficiency by using only the first six Transformer blocks.
- The process begins with transforming raw image data into a format for further processing.
- The combination of image and instruction information forms the basis for subsequent processing steps.
- The step of defining token embeddings allows representation of object labels in an understandable format.
- Translating input data into a format for predicting object labels is key in the process.
- Generating predictions for object labels is based on input data and preceding tokens.
- Modeling relationships between different parts of the image and corresponding object labels is crucial.
- Refining the model and improving performance is achieved through cross entropy loss optimization.
- Efficiently generating multiple object label predictions at once is enabled by one-shot sampling.
- Streamlining the model and improving efficiency is achieved by truncating the language decoder.
- The process involves feeding images into a backbone model to obtain image embeddings.
- The use of a pre-trained language model with 32k textual tokens is essential for defining token embeddings.
- Concatenating image embeddings with instruction token embeddings forms the input token embeddings.
- Employing a combination of linear projection and pre-trained language model in the language decoder is crucial.
