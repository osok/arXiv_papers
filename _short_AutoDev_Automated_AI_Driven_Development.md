# SUMMARY
The paper discusses a systematic framework for orchestrating AI agents in software engineering tasks, focusing on configuration, communication, parsing, and output organization.

# IDEAS:
- Users configure rules and actions for AI agents via YAML files defining commands and permissions.
- Tailored interactions and specific guidelines for AI agents are set during task execution.
- The conversation manager initializes conversation history and facilitates seamless communication.
- Ensures all parties are engaged and informed throughout the interaction process.
- The parser interprets responses, validates commands, and enforces permissions to prevent errors.
- Ensures compliance with user-defined guidelines by ensuring correct formatting and accuracy.
- Enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the AI agent's actions.
- The output organizer processes information from the evaluation environment.
- Selects key data, summarizes relevant content, and structures messages for user clarity.
- Enhances user experience by presenting organized and concise information for easy understanding.
- The iterative nature of the system processes user objectives, agent actions, and evaluation outcomes.
- Ensures a methodical and secure orchestration of AI agents.
- Guarantees systematic progression towards achieving software engineering objectives.
- Maintains a secure and controlled environment for task execution.
- YAML files allow precise control over the agent's capabilities.
- Conversation manager plays a pivotal role in communication facilitation.
- Parser enhances efficiency by ensuring correct formatting and accuracy of arguments.
- Output organizer structures messages for clarity and easy understanding.
- Iterative processing continues until task completion or user intervention.
- Systematic framework ensures secure orchestration of AI agents in software engineering tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
