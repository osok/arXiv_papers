# SUMMARY
The paper discusses a systematic framework for orchestrating AI agents in software engineering tasks, focusing on configuration, communication, parsing, and output organization.

# IDEAS:
- Users configure rules and actions for AI agents via YAML files.
- YAML files define commands and permissions to control the agent's capabilities.
- Tailored interactions and specific guidelines are set for AI agents.
- The conversation manager initializes conversation history.
- The conversation manager facilitates seamless communication between user, AI agents, and system.
- The parser interprets responses and validates commands.
- The parser enforces permissions to prevent errors.
- Correct formatting and accuracy of arguments are ensured by the parser.
- The output organizer processes information from the evaluation environment.
- The output organizer selects key data and summarizes relevant content.
- The output organizer structures messages for user clarity.
- Organized and concise information enhances user experience.
- Iterative processing of user objectives, agent actions, and evaluation outcomes.
- Continuous processing until task completion or user intervention.
- Methodical and secure orchestration of AI agents.
- Systematic progression towards achieving software engineering objectives.
- Secure and controlled environment for task execution.
- Enhances efficiency and accuracy of AI agent's actions.
- Ensures compliance with user-defined guidelines.
- Prevents errors through validation and enforcement of permissions.
- Facilitates seamless communication among all parties involved.
- Enhances user experience by presenting organized information.
- Ensures methodical progression towards task completion.
- Maintains a secure environment for AI agent orchestration.
- Allows for tailored interactions with AI agents.

# INSIGHTS:
