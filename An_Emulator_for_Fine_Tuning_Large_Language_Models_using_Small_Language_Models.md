# SUMMARY
The authors introduce emulated fine-tuning (F) to study capabilities gained during pre-training and fine-tuning in large language models. F allows for model upscaling, enhancing small fine-tuned models by combining them with larger pre-trained models.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) are trained in two stages: unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.
- Pre-trained models often need careful prompting to perform tasks, unlike fine-tuned models.
- Emulated fine-tuning (F) allows direct attribution of capabilities to specific training stages.
- F breaks down logits into base log probabilities and behavior Delta.
- F can emulate pre-training at one scale and fine-tuning at another.
- Pre-training at scale accumulates raw knowledge; fine-tuning at scale improves helpfulness.
- F can enhance small fine-tuned models through upscaling.
- Upscaling combines small fine-tuned models with larger pre-trained models without modifications.
- F allows emulation of modifications to the fine-tuning objective at test time.
- Fine-tuning is seen as reinforcement learning with a constraint to the pre-trained model.
- Any language model can be mapped to a reward function using F.
- F enables independent scaling of pre-training knowledge and fine-tuning skills.
- Upscaling is more practical than downscaling due to computational efficiency.
- F allows for faster sampling by adapting speculative decoding.
- Experiments focus on understanding changes when adjusting pre-training and fine-tuning scales.
- Human evaluation validates the accuracy of GPT-4 based fact-checking.
- Scaling pre-training improves accuracy; scaling fine-tuning enhances perceived usefulness.
- Dynamic test-time reward interpolation adjusts the reward function during sampling.
- Speculative decoding speeds up sampling by nearly 2.5 times without changing model samples.
- Top-P filtering prevents unintentional upweighting of unlikely continuations.
- GPT-4 is significantly more accurate at annotating factual correctness than human evaluators.

# INSIGHTS:
- Emulated fine-tuning (F) decouples pre-training and fine-tuning scales, enhancing model flexibility.
- Upscaling combines small fine-tuned models with large pre-trained models, boosting performance.
- Pre-training at scale accumulates raw knowledge; fine-tuning at scale improves task adherence.
- Dynamic test-time reward interpolation balances competing objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness.
- Speculative decoding accelerates sampling, making upscaling more efficient.
- Top-P filtering improves sample quality by preventing high probability assignment to low-quality tokens.
- GPT-4's fact-checking accuracy surpasses human evaluators, highlighting its reliability.
