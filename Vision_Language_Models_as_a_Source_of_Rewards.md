# SUMMARY
Researchers explore using vision-language models (VMS) like CLIP to create reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, enabling them to achieve language-based goals in visual environments without environment-specific fine-tuning.

# IDEAS:
- RL progress is significant where clear reward functions are available.
- Reward functions can be based on game scores, state changes, or winning/losing.
- Creating versatile RL agents requires numerous reward functions for different goals.
- Designing specific reward functions is difficult, time-consuming, and challenging to scale.
- Automatically generating reward functions is a promising approach for versatile agents.
- Vision-language models (VMS) can build reward functions in visual environments.
- VMS trained on paired images and text perform well in detection, classification, and question answering.
- Fine-tuned CLIP models can train agents for tasks like hunting and foraging in Minecraft.
- Flamingo VMS fine-tuned on visual question answering data can detect visual success for language goals.
- Off-the-shelf VMS can derive accurate reward functions for language goals in visual environments.
- Using pre-trained CLIP image and language embeddings can train agents for various language goals.
- Previous works like MineDojo fine-tune CLIP with Minecraft videos for dense shaping rewards.
- Off-the-shelf CLIP models can train a single RL agent to solve thousands of language-based goals.
- Flamingo has been used for hindsight relabeling and behavior cloning in the Playhouse environment.
- Dial uses fine-tuned CLIP on robotic data for behavior cloning with human-labeled trajectories.
- Success VQA fine-tunes Flamingo models as success detectors using visual question answering.
- Contrastive VMS like CLIP can create text-based reward models for RL agents.
- The reward model includes an image encoder and a text encoder to output binary rewards.
- Agents operate in a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) setting.
- Agents receive rewards from VMS based on observations and goals, ending episodes upon goal achievement or timeout.
- Experiments use Playhouse and Android Envy visual environments for testing tasks.
- Playhouse tasks include finding, lifting, and picking/placing objects in a virtual house.
- Android Envy tasks involve opening common and diverse apps on an emulated Android device.
- Maximizing VM rewards also maximizes ground truth rewards despite systematic gaps.
- Increasing VM size improves precision-recall curves and agent performance on ground truth metrics.
- Manually prompt engineering text templates can significantly improve agent performance.

# INSIGHTS:
- Automatically generating reward functions can overcome scalability challenges in RL.
- Vision-language models offer a versatile approach to creating reward functions for RL agents.
- Pre-trained VMS can be leveraged without environment-specific fine-tuning for RL tasks.
- Using off-the-shelf VMS simplifies training RL agents for diverse language-based goals.
- Contrastive VMS like CLIP effectively create text-based reward models for RL agents.
- Agents trained with VM rewards can achieve high performance on ground truth metrics.
- Prompt engineering text templates enhances the effectiveness of VM-based reward models.

# QUOTES:
- "Creating a reward function that leads to the achievement of a specific goal can be difficult, time-consuming, and challenging to scale."
- "Vision-language models (VMS) trained on large datasets of paired images and text have shown to perform well on a variety of visual detection, classification, and question answering tasks."
- "We propose a method of deriving a sparse binary reward for visual achievement of language goals from pre-trained CLIP image and language embeddings."
- "We believe that our work demonstrates how off-the-shelf VMS can be used to train language agents without the need for fine-tuning on environment-specific data."
- "The main differences between our work and MineDojo are that we use an off-the-shelf CLIP model, we do not use any ground truth information during RL training, and we train a single RL agent that can solve thousands of language-based goals."
- "Our goal is to create a reward function that can determine whether a language-based goal has been achieved based on an image observation."
- "We found that the agent trained to maximize the VM reward also maximizes the ground truth reward."
- "Increasing the size of the VM used for the reward model improves the precision-recall curves."
- "Prompt engineering the text template for our VM reward can significantly improve the ground truth performance."
