- Deploying larger LLMs faces challenges like computing power limitations and latency constraints.
- Encoding in LLMs is quick and parallel, but decoding is sequential and slower.
- Research aims to reduce time and cost of generating responses with LLMs.
- Combining models of different sizes can speed up decoding.
- A hybrid model uses a large model for encoding and a smaller model for decoding.
- This hybrid approach can significantly speed up tasks like translation and summarization.
- Model compression techniques like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation are explored.
- Parallel decoding generates multiple parts of the response at once but has challenges.
- The proposed method uses a large model to guide a smaller model in decoding.
- The method achieves speedups in translation and summarization with minimal performance loss.
- Conditional approaches in multimodal learning influence the method.
