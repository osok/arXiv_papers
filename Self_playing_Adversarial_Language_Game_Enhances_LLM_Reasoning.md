# SUMMARY
The text discusses enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini through self-improvement methods, specifically using an adversarial language game called adversarial taboo.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) excel in language tasks but struggle with complex reasoning.
- Enhancing LLM reasoning is crucial for advanced problem-solving and intelligence development.
- Prompt engineering and auxiliary tools improve LLM reasoning but are costly and inconsistent.
- Self-improvement methods use model-generated data to enhance LLM reasoning efficiently.
- High-quality question queries are essential for effective self-improvement methods.
- Self-improvement methods may reinforce existing biases in LLMs.
- Inspired by AlphaGo Zero, self-reasoning improvement uses self-play to enhance LLM reasoning.
- Adversarial taboo is a game where an attacker makes a defender say a target word unknowingly.
- The game improves LLM reasoning across various topics through self-play.
- Adversarial taboo is modeled as a two-player zero-sum Markov game.
- The state space represents dialogue between players, starting with the target word.
- The action space includes all possible token sequences in natural language.
- The transition function updates the state based on player actions.
- The reward function evaluates actions taken by players in each state.
- The attacker's total reward is the sum of rewards obtained throughout the game.
- The defender's total reward is the negative of the attacker's total reward.
- Prompt templates convert game states into natural language descriptions for players.
- Imitation learning ensures LLM follows game rules before self-play learning phase.
- Self-play involves LLM playing as both attacker and defender alternatively.
- Offline learning approach updates policy through reinforcement learning during self-play.
- Training instability is addressed by selecting episodes with positive rewards for attackers.
- Experiments assess effectiveness of SPaG using various open-source pre-trained LLMs.
- Evaluation criteria include reasoning benchmarks and gameplay win rates.
- Training data preparation includes target words, imitation learning data, and supervised fine-tuning data.
- Results show improvements in reasoning performance for LLaMA 2 and Baichuan 2 models.
- Ablation study indicates significant contribution of self-play and reinforcement learning to reasoning improvements.
