# SUMMARY
The paper explores various educational data sets, including Arc, MML U, Strategy QA, and GSM 8K, focusing on their difficulty and evaluation metrics.

# IDEAS:
- The Arc data set includes US grade school science questions in multiple-choice format.
- Combining Arc Easy and Arc Challenge splits offers a more comprehensive approach.
- Random performance on the Arc data set is 25%, indicating its difficulty level.
- MML U data set includes domain-specific multiple-choice questions from subjects like math, physics, biology, chemistry, and computer science.
- Focus is on high school and college-level questions termed MML stem five.
- Random performance on the MML U data set is also 25%.
- Strategy QA data set contains yes/no general knowledge trivia questions requiring compositional reasoning.
- Num reasoning steps measure indicates the number of facts combined to answer a question.
- Majority class vote performance on Strategy QA data set is 53.9%.
- GSM 8K data set consists of US grade school math word problems in direct answer format.
- Random performance on the GSM 8K data set is 0%.
- Num reasoning steps measure represents the number of steps in the solution to each problem.
- Human annotated reasoning chains are used to obtain num reasoning steps.
- Fewer hard data points exist due to the difficulty of collecting them.
- Aim is to provide measures to capture hard data points in these data sets.
- MDL metric is used to evaluate generalization performance of models on hard data points.
- No specific enhancements or modifications made to these data sets are mentioned.
- Comprehensive measures are provided to capture the difficulty of data points.
- Data sets include both easy and hard data points.
- Hard data points are more challenging to collect than easy ones.
