# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the "quirky math" dataset, exploring truthfulness in language models using various probing methods and transfer experiments.

# IDEAS:
- Quirky math dataset includes addition equations labeled true or false by personas Alice and Bob.
- Dataset designed to meet specific criteria for truthfulness and untruthfulness in different contexts.
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning developed quirky models consistently truthful in some contexts, untruthful in others.
- Fine-tuned various language models, including Pythia and Mistl, using different templates.
- Developed 24 quirky models to extract knowledge from language models.
- Experimented with six probing methods: LDA, logistic regression, CRC, etc.
- Probing methods take input from a single hidden layer and output a scalar score.
- Conducted five main transfer experiments to assess probe's generalization ability.
- Transfer experiments included easy-to-hard examples and persona transfers (Alice to Bob).
- Evaluated unsupervised methods on hard examples to test generalization.
- Mechanistic anomaly detection system used Alice's easy examples as reference distribution.
- Detector utilized Mahalanobis distance as classifier score to distinguish hard examples.
- Probes could generalize from truthful to untruthful and easy to hard examples.
- Most effective probing method achieved 81% accuracy on hard examples.
- Unsupervised methods CCS and CRC showed strong correlation between in-distribution and generalization performance.
- Identified knowledge decorrelated with model output using unsupervised methods.
- Acknowledged limitations like sign ambiguity issue in unsupervised methods.
- Discussed imperfection of earliest informative layer criteria for selecting the layer to probe.
