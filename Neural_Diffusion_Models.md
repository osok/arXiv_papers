# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a new framework for generative models that allows for nonlinear, time-dependent, and learnable data transformations, outperforming existing diffusion models in various tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Generative models mimic the probability distribution of a dataset to generate similar samples.
- Diffusion models refine data iteratively, building it up from pure noise.
- Existing diffusion models rely on a fixed process, limiting adaptability.
- Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs) allow for nonlinear, time-dependent, and learnable data transformations.
- NDMs outperform baselines in negative log likelihood and image generation quality.
- NDMs enable learning simpler generative dynamics like dynamical optimal transport.
- NDMs generalize conventional diffusion models in both discrete and continuous time settings.
- The NDM objective function upper bounds the negative log likelihood.
- NDMs can be trained efficiently by sampling time steps and calculating KL divergences.
- Continuous time NDMs transform discrete time steps into a continuous range.
- Continuous time NDMs use stochastic differential equations for the reverse process.
- NDMs learn transformations that simplify data distribution, improving predictions.
- NDMs perform better than Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for small to medium steps.
- NDMs are less robust when the number of steps is significantly reduced.
- NDMs can be combined with Linear Spectral Gaussian Mixture Models (LSGM) for better performance.
- NDMs provide additional flexibility in defining the reverse process.
- NDMs can learn simpler generative dynamics compared to conventional diffusion models.
- NDMs have twice as many parameters, resulting in slower training.
- The full objective is crucial for training NDMs to avoid transformation collapse.
- NDMs do not support conditional generation techniques with classifier guidance.
