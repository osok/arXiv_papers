# SUMMARY
The text discusses the relevance and enhancement of traditional n-gram language models (NR LMs) in the age of advanced neural large language models (LLMs). It introduces an "infinite n-gram" model (Infin) that uses a suffix array for efficient processing, showing its potential to complement and improve neural LLMs.

- Infinite n-gram model (Infin) doesn't limit the value of n, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- Suffix array data structure enables efficient counting and querying of n-grams.
- Infin model predicts the next word correctly 47% of the time for human-written text.
- Mixing Infin predictions with neural LLMs reduces perplexity by up to 23%.
- Nucleus sampling generates text most similar to human-written text.
- Infin indexes and code for making inferences are shared publicly for further research.
- Traditional NR models face issues with zero counts, leading to backoff techniques.
- Infin model ensures valid probability distribution without needing probability adjustments.
- Suffix array construction is efficient, taking up only seven bytes of storage per token.
