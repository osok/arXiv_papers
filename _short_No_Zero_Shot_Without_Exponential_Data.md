# SUMMARY
The paper presents a four-step methodology to enhance concept frequency estimation and search efficiency across text and image modalities.

# IDEAS:
- Define concepts as specific objects or class categories in pre-training datasets.
- Filter out less frequent nouns and compile a list of 4,29 concepts.
- Extract concept frequencies from text captions by pre-indexing captions.
- Enhance accuracy and concept frequency estimation by streamlining the process.
- Evaluate different object detectors and image tagging models for tagging images.
- The r++ model emerges as the top performer for tagging images.
- Use a multi-label tagging approach to compute concept frequencies from images.
- Integrate concept frequencies from both text and image sources.
- Calculate matched image-text frequency by identifying aligned samples.
- Address the challenge of image-text misalignment in pre-training datasets.
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of concept representation across modalities.
- Bridge the gap between textual and visual data analysis.
- Enhance scalability and effectiveness of concept identification within textual data.
- Lay the foundation for subsequent analysis with initial categorization.
- Focus on extracting concept frequencies from text captions.
- Determine the most effective approach for tagging images based on predefined concepts.
- Facilitate computation of concept frequencies from images.
- Identify samples where both image and caption align with a specific concept.
