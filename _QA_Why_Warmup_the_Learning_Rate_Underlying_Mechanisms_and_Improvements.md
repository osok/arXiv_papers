# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the benefits of learning rate warm-up, focusing on its ability to enable networks to tolerate larger learning rates, stabilize training dynamics, and improve performance across various architectures, initializations, datasets, and optimizers.

# IDEAS:
- Learning rate warm-up allows networks to tolerate larger learning rates than they otherwise would.
- Warm-up phase gradually reduces sharpness, guiding training towards flatter regions.
- Main advantage of warm-up is enabling networks to withstand larger target learning rates.
- Warm-up makes hyperparameter tuning more robust and extends the range of optimal target learning rates.
- Warm-up helps prevent training failures and performance degradation by stabilizing training dynamics.
- Warm-up keeps the network away from the divergence boundary.
- Gradient methods like SGD tie warm-up to sharpness dynamics, affecting instability thresholds.
- Sharpness determines the instability threshold Ada _ c as the learning rate increases.
- Training instabilities can be triggered by increasing learning rates, leading to temporary loss increases.
- Sharpness decreases restore stability through a self-stabilization mechanism.
- Warm-up guides training towards flatter regions that can handle higher learning rates.
- Natural sharpness evolution and warm-up induced sharpness changes have cooperative and competitive dynamics.
- Adaptive optimizers like Adam focus on reducing preconditioned sharpness to prevent large instabilities.
- Warm-up allows networks to collect accurate gradient statistics before using larger learning rates.
- Warm-up enhances performance and stability in adaptive methods.
- Setting initial learning rate to adacore C allows target learning rate to be reached earlier.
- Inducing loss increase and sharpness decrease from initialization facilitates training at higher learning rates.
- Modified warm-up schedule reaches target learning rate in fewer steps, saving computational resources.
- GI Adam initializes second moment using gradient squared, eliminating need for bias correction.
- GI Adam significantly reduces initial preconditioned sharpness, preventing large catapults.
- GI Adam improves performance across datasets and prevents training failures.
- Persistent catapult warm-up strategy progressively reduces sharpness during training.
- Persistent catapult strategy uses local sharpness information to adjust warm-up rate automatically.
- Linear warm-up involves a fixed schedule with a specified warm-up time.
- Persistent catapult strategy eliminates manual tuning of warm-up duration.
- Experiments were conducted on relatively small-scale datasets and models.
- Further investigations are needed to understand generalizability to larger-scale settings.
- Study did not explore dependence on hyperparameters like beta1, beta2, and epsilon for Adam optimizer.
