# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Activation Beacon method to condense raw activations in Long Sequence Language Models (LLMs) for efficient processing.

# IDEAS:
- Activation Beacon condenses raw activations in Long Sequence Language Models (LLMs).
- Context is divided into intervals, and beacons are dispatched to each interval's end.
- Beacons transform input hidden states to query raw activations within intervals.
- Different attention schemes for beacons were explored; step-wise expansion is optimal.
- Beacons increase the information processed within the same context window.
- Beaconed Auto Regression processes condensed activations and raw activations with sliding windows.
- Next token prediction is based on relative positions of beacons and ordinary tokens.
- Sliding window size is small and bounded by maximum context length for efficiency.
- Beacon is a plug-in module for LLMs with parameters like embedding and projection matrices.
- Beacon is learned while LLM parameters remain fixed, condensing raw activations for past contexts.
- Beacon accounts for less than a third of the LLM's original size.
- Activation Beacon method utilizes rich information from long sequence data.
- Overcomes the constraint of maximum context length in LLMs.
- Beacons and sliding windows improve efficiency in processing long context data.
- Beacon is easily integrated into existing LLMs as a plug-and-play module.
- High training efficiency on short sequence data, generalizable for longer contexts.
- Stepwise sampling of condensing ratios achieves optimal performance.
- Stepwise expansion attention scheme is optimal for beacons.
- Method allows utilization of rich information from long sequence data.
- Achieves high training efficiency on short sequence data.
