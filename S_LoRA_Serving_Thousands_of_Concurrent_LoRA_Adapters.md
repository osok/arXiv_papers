# SUMMARY
The paper discusses efficient serving of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) using a scalable system called sLaur, which optimizes memory and computation for high throughput.

# IDEAS:
- Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks has proven to be effective.
- Serving multiple fine-tuned variants concurrently can reduce throughput and increase latency.
- sLaur efficiently manages memory and employs optimized Cuda kernels for batched inference.
- sLaur introduces a novel tensor parallelism strategy to serve thousands of Laura adapters.
- LLMs based on the Transformer architecture have billions to trillions of parameters.
- Decoding in LLMs is more memory-intensive than computation-intensive due to the KV cache.
- Orca schedules tasks at the token level to handle dynamic requests efficiently.
- Page detention optimizes memory efficiency by managing dynamic KV cache tensors.
- Tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, and pipeline parallelism spread models across multiple GPUs.
- sLaur's batching strategy separates base model computation from Laura adapters.
- Unified paging supports dynamically loading Laura adapters, reducing memory fragmentation.
- Custom Cuda kernels minimize latency overhead in sLaur.
- Adapter clustering limits active adapters in a batch to boost efficiency.
- Admission control in sLaur maintains performance when traffic exceeds system capacity.
- Unified paging uses a unified memory pool to manage KV caches and adapter weights.
- Prefetching adapter weights reduces IO time for adapter swapping.
- Custom Cuda kernels handle non-contiguous memory in the unified memory pool.
- Tensor parallelism strategies minimize communication costs and optimize memory usage.
- sLaur achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to its variants.
- sLaur can serve 2,000 adapters simultaneously with minimal overhead.
- Early abort strategy in sLaur optimizes user satisfaction and slow attainment.
- Real-world tests show sLaur performs strongly with varying request rates and durations.
- Superlinear scaling observed when increasing GPUs from 2 to 4 due to memory constraints alleviation.
- Alternative design merging adapter weights declines in performance with more than two adapters.
- Related work includes specialized serving systems for the Transformer architecture.
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Laura, prefix tuning, and prompt tuning are widely adopted.

# INSIGHTS:
- Efficient memory management is crucial for serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs concurrently.
- Custom Cuda kernels and tensor parallelism strategies significantly enhance throughput and reduce latency.
- Dynamic request handling at the token level increases throughput in online settings.
- Unified paging effectively reduces memory fragmentation and balances dynamic KV caches and adapter weights.
- Prefetching adapter weights minimizes IO time, optimizing system efficiency.
- Adapter clustering boosts efficiency but may impact latency and fairness among adapters.
- Early abort strategy ensures better performance under high traffic conditions.
- Superlinear scaling is achievable by alleviating memory constraints with additional GPUs.
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods can be applied to various Transformer-based architectures.
