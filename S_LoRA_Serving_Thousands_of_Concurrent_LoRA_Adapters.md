# SUMMARY
The paper discusses efficient serving of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) using a scalable system called SLaur, which optimizes memory and computation for high throughput.

# IDEAS:
- Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks has proven effective but can be costly.
- Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) allows efficient fine-tuning by updating low-rank additive matrices.
- LoRA achieves performance similar to full weight fine-tuning with fewer parameters.
- Serving multiple fine-tuned models concurrently can reduce throughput and increase latency.
- SLaur is a scalable serving system that manages memory and employs optimized CUDA kernels.
- SLaur introduces a novel tensor parallelism strategy for efficient multi-GPU serving.
- SLaur can serve thousands of LoRA adapters on a single GPU or across multiple GPUs.
- LoRA keeps pre-trained base model weights the same and adds trainable low-rank matrices.
- LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters and memory consumption during inference.
- Merging low-rank matrices with base model weights eliminates added overhead during inference.
- Orca schedules tasks at the token level to handle dynamic requests efficiently.
- Page detention borrows concepts from virtual memory to manage dynamic KV cache tensors.
- SLaur separates base model computation from individual LoRA computations for high throughput.
- Unified paging supports dynamically loading LoRA adapters, reducing memory fragmentation.
- Custom CUDA kernels minimize latency overhead in SLaur's batching strategy.
- Adapter clustering limits active adapters in a batch to allocate more memory to KV cache.
- Admission control in SLaur maintains performance when traffic exceeds system capacity.
- Unified paging manages both KV cache and adapter weights in a unified memory pool.
- Prefetching adapter weights reduces IO time for adapter swapping in SLaur.
- Custom CUDA kernels handle non-contiguous memory layouts for LoRA computations.
- Tensor parallelism strategies minimize communication costs in multi-GPU inference.
- SLaur achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to other systems.
- SLaur's memory pool and custom kernels are effective as the number of adapters increases.
- SLaur scales to a larger number of adapters without additional overhead.
- Real-world tests show SLaur performs strongly with real-world workloads.
- SLaur's early abort strategy outperforms other scheduling strategies in user satisfaction.
