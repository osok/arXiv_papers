# IDEAS:
- Long context language models (LCLM) simplify tasks without complex tools and pipelines.
- Combining processes into one model improves efficiency and reduces errors.
- Techniques like few-shot examples and Chain of Thought prompting enhance LCLM.
- Existing benchmarks often rely on artificial tasks or fixed-length datasets.
- The Loft Benchmark includes six tasks with 35 datasets covering text, visual, and audio data.
- Loft allows automatic generation of longer context lengths up to 1 million tokens.
- Loft can be expanded to tens of millions of tokens for comprehensive evaluation.
- Loft focuses on areas where LCLM can bring significant changes, like retrieval and SQL processing.
- Corpus in Context (CIC) prompting allows large corpora to be processed within the context window.
- LCLM can perform comparably to specialized models but need improvement in complex reasoning tasks.
- Different prompting strategies impact LCLM performance, highlighting the need for further research.
- Evaluating LCLM on genuinely long context tasks is crucial for real-world applications.
- Shared corpora ensure fair evaluation by preventing positional biases.
- Specialized retriever models use the same corpora for fair comparison.
- CIC prompting combines established strategies tailored to leverage LCLM capabilities.
- Task-specific instructions guide LCLM behavior and improve task accuracy.
