# SUMMARY
The text discusses the importance of accurately determining a model's confidence level for informed decision-making, particularly in natural language generation tasks. It explores non-logit-based approaches for eliciting uncertainty in language models, including verbalized confidence and consistency-based methods, and proposes hybrid methods combining both indicators. The study evaluates these methods using various large language models and benchmarks, highlighting the need for further research in confidence elicitation.
