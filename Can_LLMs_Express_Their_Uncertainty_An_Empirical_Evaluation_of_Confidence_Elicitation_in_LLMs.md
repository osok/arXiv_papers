# SUMMARY
The text discusses methods for eliciting confidence in large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning or accessing proprietary data. It explores verbalized and consistency-based confidence methods, proposing hybrid approaches to improve accuracy. The study evaluates these methods using various LLMs and benchmarks, highlighting the need for further research in challenging tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Effective uncertainty expression is crucial for human-machine interaction and decision-making.
- LLMs often suggest overconfidence, focusing on predicting the next token rather than statement reliability.
- Closed-source LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 lack access to logins or embeddings.
- Confidence elicitation methods are still developing, with current methods not directly providing confidence levels.
- Two main objectives: explore non-fine-tuning confidence elicitation and compare methods for accurate uncertainty estimates.
- Key factors in LLMs for measuring uncertainty: text produced and consistency across multiple responses.
- Verbal prompts can directly elicit model uncertainty, leveraging LLMs' verbal abilities.
- Several prompting strategies can enhance verbalized confidence, including Chain of Thought and multi-step methods.
- Consistency-based methods generate multiple responses to assess confidence through uniformity.
- Hybrid methods combine consistency-based and verbalized confidence for detailed confidence information.
- LLMs tend to be overly confident when expressing confidence verbally.
- Consistency-based methods perform better than verbalized counterparts, especially in arithmetic tasks.
- Hybrid methods deliver the best performance in most cases, combining verbalized confidence and consistency.
- Methods still struggle with challenging tasks requiring professional knowledge.
- Calibration aims to sync network confidence with actual accuracy, addressing overconfidence.
- Scaling-based and binning-based methods are proposed for calibration in neural networks.
- Pre-training improves model calibration, with larger models better calibrated on multiple-choice questions.
- Confidence elicitation without fine-tuning or accessing proprietary data is explored.
- Verbalized confidence encourages models to share confidence levels directly.
- Zero-shot verbalized confidence remains largely unexplored.
- Consistency-based methods generate several responses to assess uniformity as an indicator of confidence.
- Hybrid methods leverage both consistency-based and verbalized confidence for more accurate assessments.

# INSIGHTS:
- Effective uncertainty expression is vital for human-machine collaboration and decision-making.
- LLMs often exhibit overconfidence, focusing on token prediction over statement reliability.
- Closed-source LLMs lack access to internal data, complicating confidence elicitation.
- Current confidence elicitation methods don't directly provide user-friendly confidence levels.
- Combining verbalized and consistency-based methods offers more accurate confidence assessments.
- Verbal prompts can leverage LLMs' verbal abilities to elicit model uncertainty.
- Consistency-based methods outperform verbalized counterparts, especially in arithmetic tasks.
- Hybrid methods combining both approaches deliver the best performance overall.
- Calibration techniques aim to correct overconfidence in neural networks.
- Larger pre-trained models show better calibration on multiple-choice questions.
