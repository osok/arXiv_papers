# SUMMARY
The section discusses advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their integration with visual understanding to create large vision language models (LVLMs). It introduces LVM Interpret, a tool for analyzing and explaining LVLMs' inner workings.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs like GPT and LLC show impressive understanding and reasoning abilities.
- Visual understanding is incorporated into LLMs by adding a vision encoder.
- LVLMs excel at completing both textual and visual tasks based on human instructions.
- LLMs outperform humans in summarization, translation, and question answering.
- Hallucination remains a significant issue for LLMs, generating false information.
- Hallucination in LVLMs can be amplified by the visual aspect.
- Explaining model outputs to address hallucination is increasingly challenging.
- LVM Interpret adapts various interpretability methods for interactive analysis of LVLMs.
- Techniques like raw attention visualization, relevancy maps, and causal interpretation are incorporated.
- LVM Interpret is applicable to any LVLM with a transformer-based LLM frontend.
- A case study on LLAVA demonstrates how LVM Interpret enhances understanding of model operations.
- Interpretability tools have been developed to explain deep learning models using explanatory graphs and decision trees.
- Transformer architectures compute relevancy scores across model layers for interpretability.
- Vision Transformers (ViTs) are gaining traction in tasks like image captioning and object detection.
- There is growing demand for interpretability in medical applications like pathology and COVID-19 analysis.
- Multimodal models are prevalent in healthcare and multimedia domains.
- Interpretability studies on multimodal models aim to enhance decision-making processes in critical domains.
- LVM Interpret complements existing solutions, improving LVLM interpretability and boosting confidence in predictions.
- Developed using Gradio, LVM Interpret offers a user-friendly interface for multimodal interactions.
- Users can upload images, issue queries, and make basic modifications to input images for model probing.
- Attention weights are stored internally and presented to users for visualization.
- Relevancy maps and causal graphs related to model outputs empower users to interpret responses effectively.
- Relevancy maps show which parts of an input are important for the model's output.
- Scores are given to each part of the input based on its effect on the final decision.
- For images, relevancy maps are reshaped into a grid matching the original image layout.
- Causal interpretation of attention in Transformers leads to the CLEANN method.
- CLEANN helps derive causal explanations from the model's attention by masking certain tokens.
- Analyzing causal graphs helps identify minimal sets of tokens explaining specific output tokens.
- The LLAVA model on the MMVP dataset shows text tokens can manipulate model output more than image tokens.
