# SUMMARY
The paper presents a five-step process for using a meta model and domain-specific expert models to provide accurate solutions.

# IDEAS:
- Transform raw query into a suitable template using a transformation function.
- Add initial instructions to the meta model's prompt history to guide responses.
- Determine the meta model's next action based on the current message list.
- Meta model can directly address the query or consult a domain-specific expert.
- Engage a domain-specific expert model if the meta model's result is unsatisfactory.
- Expert model receives instructions extracted from the meta model's output.
- Expert model responds based on information shared by the meta model.
- Extract and return the final answer from the meta model's response.
- Identify the final answer using specific markers or indicators.
- Append an error message to the message list if no final answer is found.
- Ensure procedure is robust and can handle unexpected outputs.
- Meta prompting approach combines perspectives of multiple domain-specific models.
- Shallow hierarchical configuration with meta model as central authority.
- Coordination and synthesis of responses from different models.
- Simplifies communication between experts and centralizes operations.
- Leads to more comprehensive, robust, and accurate solutions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Meta model can either address queries directly or consult domain-specific experts.
- Error handling ensures robustness by appending error messages to the message list.
- Combining multiple domain-specific models provides comprehensive solutions.
- Shallow hierarchical configuration centralizes authority in the meta model.
- Meta prompting approach simplifies communication between experts.
