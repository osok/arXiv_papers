- Guided diffusion significantly improved image quality over GAN-based methods.
- Technologies like Glide, Imagine, DALL-E 2, and Stable Diffusion achieved photorealistic images.
- Diffusion models' application beyond visual generation remains relatively unexplored.
- The novel method, neural network diffusion P diff, generates high-performing model parameters.
- Parameter generation involves creating neural network parameters excelling in specific tasks.
- Both neural network training and diffusion-based image generation transition from random noise to specific distributions.
- High-quality images and high-performing parameters can be broken down into simpler distributions.
- Neural network diffusion P diff uses a latent diffusion model to generate new parameters.
- An autoencoder is trained on a subset of parameters from models optimized by SGD.
- The method achieves similar or better performance than models trained by SGD across various datasets.
- Models generated by P diff significantly differ from trained models, showing synthesis of new parameters.
- Diffusion models typically involve forward and reverse processes across multiple steps.
- The main goal during training is to find reverse transitions maximizing forward transitions' likelihood.
- During inference, novel samples are generated from random noise using optimized denoising parameters.
- P diff involves selecting a subset of parameters from trained models and flattening them into vectors.
- An encoder extracts latent representations from these vectors, and a decoder reconstructs the parameters.
- Random noise augmentation improves the robustness and generalization of the autoencoder.
- A four-layer encoder and decoder are used, minimizing mean square error loss between reconstructed and original parameters.
- Diffusion process applied to latent representations addresses memory issues with large parameter sets.
- DDPM optimization introduces noise step-by-step, controlled by hyperparameters.
- A special network gradually removes noise to create new effective parameters.
- Neural network parameters differ from image pixels in data type, dimensions, range, and interpretation.
- 1D convolutions are used instead of 2D in autoencoder and parameter generation processes.
- Experiments show the method performs as well as or better than baselines across various datasets.
- Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness in generating neural network parameters.
- Generated models become more diverse as the number of original models increases.
- The approach relates to stochastic and Bayesian neural networks, learning priors over network parameters.
