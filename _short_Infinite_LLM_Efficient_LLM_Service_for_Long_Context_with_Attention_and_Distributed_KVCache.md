# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Dist Attention algorithm, which optimizes attention computation in Transformer models, and the Disc KV LM engine for efficient memory management in language models.

# IDEAS:
- Dist Attention breaks traditional attention computation into smaller units called macro attentions (Moss).
- Moss and their corresponding key-value (KV) caches or R blocks enable independent model parallelism.
- Performing Moss separately and aggregating results reduces attention computation overhead.
- Disc KV LM engine integrates with Dist Attention for efficient KV cache management in language models.
- The engine coordinates memory usage across GPUs and CPUs in data centers.
- It includes a global manager (G manager) and a resource manager (R manager) for scalable resource management.
- The engine borrows available memory spaces from other instances during memory shortfalls.
- A new algorithm, DGFM, addresses memory fragmentation in distributed KV cache environments.
- Communication optimization overlaps attention computation with remote R block transfer.
- High-speed interconnect networks ensure efficient communication between instances.
- Overlapping computation and communication tasks minimizes communication overhead.
- Disc KV LM achieves throughput comparable to Baseline while supporting longer context lengths.
- Performance improvements range from 1.3x to 2.4x compared to Baseline, depending on the dataset.
- Dist KV LM experiences negligible latency disturbance compared to live migration.
- DGFM optimizes memory allocation by recalling lent memory spaces.
- Ablation study shows a 5% to 10% increase in latency due to additional overhead of Dist Attention.

# INSIGHTS
