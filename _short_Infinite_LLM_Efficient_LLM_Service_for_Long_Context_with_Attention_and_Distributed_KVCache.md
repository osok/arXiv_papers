# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Dist Attention algorithm, which optimizes attention computation in Transformer models, and the Disc KV LM engine for efficient memory management in language models.

# IDEAS:
- Dist Attention algorithm revolutionizes traditional attention computation by breaking it into smaller units called macro attentions.
- Macro attentions (Moss) and corresponding key-value (KV) caches or R blocks are introduced.
- Independent model parallelism strategies and memory management for attention layers versus other layers.
- Performing Moss separately and aggregating results significantly reduces attention computation overhead.
- Disc KV LM engine integrates with Dist Attention for efficient KV cache management in language model services.
- The engine coordinates memory usage across GPUs and CPUs in data centers.
- Global manager (G manager) and resource manager (R manager) ensure scalable resource management.
- Engine proactively borrows available memory spaces from other instances during memory shortfalls.
- New algorithm DGFM addresses memory fragmentation in distributed KV cache environments.
- Communication optimization overlaps attention computation with remote R block transfer.
- High-speed interconnect networks ensure efficient communication between instances.
- Overlapping computation and communication tasks minimize communication overhead.
- Performance evaluation shows comparable throughput to baseline while supporting longer context lengths.
- Throughput improvement ranges from 2x to 1.19x in context length benchmarks.
- End-to-end performance improvements range from 1.3x to 2.4x depending on datasets.
- Comparison with live migration shows negligible latency disturbance for Dist KV LM.
- Live migration incurs significant overhead compared to Dist KV LM.
- DGFM algorithm optimizes memory allocation by recalling lent memory spaces.
- Higher overall throughput is maintained compared to systems without DGFM.
- Ablation study shows a 5% to 10% increase in latency due to additional overhead of Dist Attention.
