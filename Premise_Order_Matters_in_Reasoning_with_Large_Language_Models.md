# SUMMARY
This text explores the impact of premise order on large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks, revealing that LLMs perform best when premises are arranged in the same order as in the ground truth proof. Different LLMs show preferences for specific premise orderings, significantly influencing their reasoning performance.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs have achieved human-level performance in solving STEM problems and generating code.
- LLMs exhibit cognitive biases similar to humans, such as the reversal curse and distractibility.
- The order of premises significantly affects LLMs' reasoning performance.
- Humans are not significantly affected by premise order in deductive reasoning.
- LLMs perform best when premises are arranged in the same sequence as in the correct proof.
- Different LLMs show preferences for specific premise orderings.
- Rearranging premises can lead to more than a 30% drop in accuracy for LLMs.
- LLMs prefer reasoning in a linear, left-to-right fashion.
- Addressing the premise order effect in future training and modeling efforts remains an open challenge.
- The presence of distracting rules significantly affects LLM reasoning performance.
- LLMs struggle more with alternative premise orderings even when the original problem is correctly solved.
- Forward order generally yields the best performance for LLMs.
- Backward order is preferred by some models but not all.
- The accuracy of proof suffers for problems that demand more reasoning steps and contain more sentences.
- The most frequent error across all LLMs is their failure to account for temporal order.
- Including irrelevant context in a problem statement can significantly reduce performance on reasoning benchmarks.
- Recognizing A is B does not imply understanding B is A for LLMs.
- LLMs perform best when the ordering of rules aligns with the ground truth proof.
- LLM reasoning performance is highly sensitive to the ordering of premises.
- The reversal curse demonstrates that recognizing A is B does not imply understanding B is A.

# INSIGHTS:
- LLMs exhibit cognitive biases similar to humans, affecting their reasoning performance.
- Premise order significantly impacts LLMs' accuracy, unlike human deductive reasoning.
- Linear, left-to-right reasoning is preferred by LLMs due to their autoregressive design.
- Distracting information and irrelevant rules exacerbate the effect of premise order on LLMs.
- Addressing premise order effects is crucial for improving future LLM training and modeling.
