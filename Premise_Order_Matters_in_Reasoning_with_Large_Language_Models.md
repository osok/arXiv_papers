# SUMMARY
This text explores the impact of premise order on large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks, revealing that LLMs perform best when premises are arranged in the same order as the ground truth proof. Different LLMs show varying sensitivities to premise orders, with some achieving better performance when the order is reversed.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs have achieved and sometimes surpassed human performance in solving STEM problems and generating code.
- LLMs exhibit failure modes similar to human cognitive biases, such as the reversal curse and distractibility.
- The order of premises significantly affects LLMs' reasoning performance, unlike humans.
- LLMs perform best when premises are arranged in the same sequence as the correct proof.
- Rearranging premises can lead to more than a 30% drop in LLM accuracy.
- Different LLMs show preferences for specific premise orderings.
- GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo perform better with premises in reverse order.
- Palm 2L struggles with reversed premise order.
- Premise order affects mathematical reasoning in LLMs, especially for longer problems.
- LLMs prefer reasoning in a linear, left-to-right fashion due to their autoregressive design.
- Addressing the premise order effect in future training remains an open challenge.
- The benchmark includes 27,000 problems to evaluate LLM performance across various premise orders.
- LLMs struggle more with alternative orderings even when the original problem is correctly solved.
- Forward order generally yields the best performance for LLMs.
- Backward order is preferred by some models but not all.
- LLMs show reduced performance on reordered problems compared to original descriptions.
- Accuracy drops more significantly for problems requiring more reasoning steps and containing more sentences.
- Prediction errors are mainly due to LLMs' tendency to use numbers in the order they appear in the text.
- Including irrelevant context in a problem statement significantly reduces LLM performance.
- The reversal curse demonstrates that recognizing A is B does not imply understanding B is A.

# INSIGHTS:
- Premise order significantly impacts LLM reasoning, unlike human deductive reasoning.
- Different LLMs have unique preferences for premise order, affecting their accuracy.
- Linear, left-to-right reasoning aligns with LLMs' autoregressive design and training biases.
- Addressing premise order effects is crucial for improving future LLM training and modeling.
- Including irrelevant information exacerbates the negative impact of premise order on LLM performance.
- The reversal curse highlights a fundamental challenge in LLM reasoning capabilities.
- Benchmarking with varied premise orders reveals significant differences in LLM handling of tasks.
- Mathematical reasoning in LLMs is highly sensitive to sentence order, affecting problem-solving accuracy.
- Error analysis shows that temporal order and sequence of quantities are critical for accurate predictions.
- Human-like preferences for immediate conclusions influence LLM performance on logical reasoning tasks.
