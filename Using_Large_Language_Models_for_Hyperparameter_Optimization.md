- LLMs can improve traditional hyperparameter tuning with small search budgets.
- LLMs perform well over longer horizons of 30 evaluations.
- LLMs can generate training code to improve validation performance, reducing human specification needs.
- Code generation provides strong initialization, reducing initial search for unlikely configurations.
- Hyperparameter optimization is a two-level problem: training and validation objectives.
- Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model to map hyperparameters to validation loss.
- Bayesian optimization selects hyperparameters by optimizing an acquisition function balancing exploration and exploitation.
- Manual search often involves trial and error based on prior knowledge or experience.
- LLMs trained on internet-scale data show emerging capabilities in new settings.
- Chat prompt method involves giving LLMs dialogue history for hyperparameter suggestions.
- Compressed prompt method condenses search history into a single initial message.
- Code generation avoids the need for a specific search space by treating source code as hyperparameters.
- Random search often outperforms grid and manual search in low-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.
- Chain of Thought reasoning positively impacts GPT-3.5 and marginally impacts GPT-4 performance.
