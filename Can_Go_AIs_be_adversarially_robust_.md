# SUMMARY
The paper explores enhancing the robustness of superhuman Go agents against adversarial attacks, finding that current defense strategies are insufficient.

# IDEAS:
- Ensuring AI systems work reliably is crucial, especially in critical safety systems.
- AI systems often fail drastically when faced with tricky inputs.
- Enhancing robustness in specific domains like Go can help design resilient AI systems.
- Go, being a zero-sum game, allows for full robustness while maintaining good average performance.
- Previous research identified attacks that can defeat even the best Go AI, including KataGo.
- Training KataGo with examples of known attacks did not provide a complete solution.
- Iterated adversarial training involves alternately training a victim and an adversary.
- Despite iterated adversarial training, new adversaries can still exploit weaknesses.
- Replacing the neural network backbone with a vision transformer does not eliminate vulnerabilities.
- Robustness definitions include human robust, training compute robust, and inference compute robust.
- Adversarial MCTS is used to train adversaries against increasingly stronger victims.
- Iterated adversarial training prioritizes robustness over average case capabilities.
- The final victim remained vulnerable even at high visit counts.
- Both victims and adversaries could defeat opponents from previous iterations.
- Vision transformer-based Go AI also showed susceptibility to cyclic attacks.
- Adversarial policies provide a minimum measure of how much an agent can be exploited.
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning shows promise in terms of robustness.
- Vision transformers exhibit potential for robustness but have different learning biases.
- Humans still outperform AI defenses and can execute attacks against them.
- Enhancing defense mechanisms by expanding the attack corpus is suggested.
- Exploring multi-agent reinforcement learning and altering threat models could enhance robustness.
