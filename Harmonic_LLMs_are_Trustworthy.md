# SUMMARY
A novel, model-agnostic method evaluates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in real-time using a metric called gamma, correlating low gamma with trustworthy responses.

# IDEAS:
- Gamma measures local deviation from harmonicity to assess LLM reliability.

- Gamma values close to zero indicate trustworthiness.
- Models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Smog 72B have low gamma values.
- Users need a trustworthiness score for LLM responses.
- Harmonic robustness measures how closely a function aligns with being harmonic.
- Adding random non-printing characters to input strings assesses LLM output stability.
- Consistent output with gamma equals zero suggests stability.
- Gamma can help identify unreliable responses in LLMs.
- Evaluating LLM robustness involves checking consistency across different input styles.
- The Flask method assesses LLMs based on score consistency across input styles.
