# SUMMARY
A novel, model-agnostic method evaluates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) using a metric called gamma, correlating low gamma with trustworthy responses.

# IDEAS:
- Gamma measures local deviation from harmonicity to assess LLM reliability.
- The method is model-agnostic and unsupervised.
- Human annotation experiments show gamma correlates with incorrect or misleading responses.
- Stochastic gradient ascent can uncover adversarial inputs by following gamma gradients.
- Gamma values close to zero indicate trustworthiness in LLMs.
- Popular LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT have low gamma values.
- Users need a trustworthiness score for LLM responses.
- Harmonic robustness measures how closely a function aligns with being harmonic.
- Adding random non-printing characters to input strings assesses LLM output stability.
- Consistent output with gamma equals zero suggests stability.
- Gamma helps identify unreliable responses in LLMs.
- Evaluations show low gamma models are more trustworthy.
- The Flask method checks LLM score consistency across input styles.
- Instruction-tuned LLMs struggle with rephrased instructions.
- PromptBench tests LLM resilience to adversarial prompts.
- Adding noise to input prompts evaluates LLM robustness.
- Differentially private prompt learning preserves privacy while learning from prompts.
- Noisy annotations affect model performance.
- Self-denoising approaches clean corrupted inputs without separate robustness training.
- Chain of Thought uses LLMs to reflect on result consistency.
- Sensitivity to perturbations will always exist in NLP literature.
- Larger models generally receive higher ratings in evaluations.
- Low gamma values correlate with high trustworthiness scores.
- Higher gamma values often lead to lower quality responses.
- Larger models like GPT-4 exhibit lower gamma values than smaller models like LLaMA 2.
- Gamma distributions reveal insights into model trustworthiness.
- Newer models show improved trustworthiness compared to older ones.
- Gamma provides a valuable tool for evaluating LLM reliability.
- Adversarial examples can be uncovered by manipulating gamma gradients.
- Random UTF8 characters can generate false content in adversarial examples.

# INSIGHTS:
- Gamma metric effectively identifies unreliable LLM responses.
