# SUMMARY
The text discusses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), focusing on representation fine-tuning (ReFT) and its efficiency and effectiveness.

# IDEAS:

- Adapters are a common type of PFT that modify a subset of model weights.
- Recent adapters like LoRA use low-rank approximations to reduce trainable parameters.
- High-precision adapters can be trained on low-precision models without losing performance.
- Adapters are more efficient than methods introducing new model components like prefix tuning.
- Representation fine-tuning (ReFT) manipulates model representations instead of weights.
- ReFT methods can be integrated into weight-based PFTs.
- Low-rank linear subspace ReFT (Low-ReFT) intervenes on hidden representations within a low-rank projection matrix.
- Low-ReFT outperforms existing PFTs in efficiency and effectiveness.
- Interventional interpretability uses interventions to understand and control model behavior.
- Concepts like gender, number, and reasoning are encoded linearly in neural networks.
- Distributed interchange intervention tests if a concept is encoded in a linear subspace.
- Low-ReFT edits representations to align with a linear projection for better task predictions.
- Low-ReFT applies to both generation and classification tasks.
- ReFT methods involve non-overlapping interventions on hidden representations during the model's forward pass.
- Low-ReFT is evaluated on various NLP benchmarks, showing superior performance and parameter efficiency.
- Common sense reasoning tasks show state-of-the-art performance with Low-ReFT.
