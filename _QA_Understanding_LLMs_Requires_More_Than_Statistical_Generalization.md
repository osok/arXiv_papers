- Zero-shot rule extrapolation with a decoder-only Transformer showed 43.7% rule extrapolation ability.
- Models trained in adversarial and Oracle settings displayed varying rule extrapolation performance despite same minimal test loss.
- Future research should focus on qualitative characteristics enabling reasoning about new tasks and alternative generalization measures.
