- Joint training strategy leverages high-quality internal image datasets to improve frame quality.
- The video-to-video module shares the same backbone and spatial layers as the i2v module.
- The v2v module is fine-tuned using a high-resolution video subset for super resolution.
- The video frame interpolation module uses an enhanced deformable separable convolution head.
- Human evaluations compared Magic Video V2 with other leading text-to-video systems.
- Evaluators rated videos based on quality, consistency, and structural errors.
- Results showed a preference for Magic Video V2 in terms of human visual perception.
- Magic Video V2 corrects and refines imperfections from the text-to-image module.
- The framework produces smooth and visually pleasing videos from text descriptions.
- Appearance encoding, noise prior, and control net modules enhance video quality.
- Magic Video V2 can work with different text-to-image models.
