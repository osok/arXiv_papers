# SUMMARY
The paper evaluates multimodal large language models (MLMs) across text, code, image, and video using 230 case studies, comparing closed and open-source models.

# IDEAS:
- Evaluated multimodal large language models (MLMs) across text, code, image, and video modalities.
- Collected 230 manually designed case studies for comprehensive analysis of MLMs.
- Aimed to shed light on capabilities and limitations of current MLMs in complex tasks.
- Compared closed-source models like Gemini Pro and GP4 with six open-source counterparts.
- Findings suggest MLM performance still falls short of public expectations in reliability.
- Identified specific areas where further development is needed in MLM technology.
- Evaluation included both closed-source and open-source large language models.
- Uncovered 14 empirical findings offering insights into strengths and weaknesses of MLMs.
- Findings are crucial for guiding future research and development in the field.
- Summarized qualitative results into 12 scores reflecting MLM performance across four modalities.
- Scoring system covers text, code, image, video, generalization, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning.
- Provides a clear overview of how models perform across different dimensions.
- Insights are invaluable for researchers and developers working on multimodal tasks.
- Offers a roadmap for enhancing performance and reliability of future models.
- Comprehensive study aims to contribute to ongoing development and refinement of MLMs.
- Ensures MLMs can meet diverse and evolving needs of users across various domains.
- Performance comparison included both closed-source and open-source models.
- Empirical findings play a pivotal role in understanding MLM capabilities and limitations.
- Study highlights the current state of MLM performance and potential areas for improvement.
- Evaluation spanned the breadth of applications MLMs are subjected to.
