# SUMMARY
The proposed method aims to integrate essential components of large language models (LLMs) into a unified framework called AGILE, optimizing learning and operation processes for LLM agents.

# IDEAS:
- Integrating LLM components into a unified framework optimizes end-to-end learning and operation processes.
- AGILE framework unifies planning, reflection, tool use, and advice-seeking within a cohesive structure.
- Streamlining interactions between LLM memory, tools, and executive modules enhances instruction following and reasoning.
- Reinforcement learning (RL) improves the policy of invoking different modules in LLM agents.
- AGILE framework incorporates LLM, memory, tools, and executor modules for seamless coordination.
- Memory module enhances the agent's ability to handle historical data and accumulated knowledge.
- Tools module enables interaction with external resources like search tools for additional information.
- Executive module interprets LLM instructions to activate corresponding modules and collect responses.
- Proactively seeking advice from human experts ensures high-level accuracy in complex questions.
- Learning from human experts enhances the agent's adaptability to new tasks.
- Accumulating knowledge from expert advice allows continuous improvement and evolution of the agent.
- Policy learning involves training a language model using a token-level Markov decision process (MDP).
- Imitation learning fine-tunes the LLM by generating trajectories from observing human experts.
- Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is applied to optimize the LLM using rewards assigned to action tokens.
- Attention mask guides the training process in both imitation learning and RL.
- AGILE Vic 13B P agent showed a 9.2% improvement in short answers compared to GPT-4 agents.
- AGILE Vic 7B PPO surpassed GPT-4 agents in average total scores on the product QA Benchmark.
- Seeking advice cost affects performance, with adjustments leading to changes in advice rate and accuracy.
- Disabling advice-seeking leads to a 10.7% drop in accuracy and a 5.0% reduction in total score.
- Forcing advice-seeking at the initial part of the trajectory decreases accuracy by 4.2%.
- Removing reflection and memory capabilities increases advice-seeking frequency and decreases total scores.
- Disabling tool use results in a 25.9% increase in advice-seeking rate.
- RL training improves relative total score by 2.3%, lowers advice-seeking rate, and boosts accuracy.
