# SUMMARY
Samba, a neural architecture, harmonizes state space models (SSMs) and attention-based models to achieve unlimited sequence length extrapolation with linear time complexity.

# IDEAS:
- Samba harmonizes strengths of SSMs and attention-based models for unlimited sequence length extrapolation.
- Existing models suffer from quadratic computation complexity or limited context extrapolation ability.
- Samba combines SSMs with attention through layerwise interleaving, Mamba, SWA, and Su glue.
- Mamba layers capture time-dependent semantics through recurrent structures and input-dependent gating.
- SWA layers address non-Markovian dependencies with a sliding window size of 2048.
- MLP layers provide nonlinear transformations and recall factual knowledge.
- Samba's hybrid approach excels in handling various language comprehension tasks.
- Parameter allocation focuses on information retrieval with a small number of attention heads.
- Samba outperforms other linear recurrent models and attention-based architectures.
- Samba achieves superior performance in language modeling tasks with unlimited length extrapolation.
- Samba can be extrapolated to 1 million length in zero shot with improved perplexity.
- Samba excels in memory recall tasks surpassing SWA-based models in recalling memories beyond 4K length.
- Samba achieves better performance on downstream long context summarization tasks.
- Samba's architectural design is validated through rigorous analyses and ablation studies.
- Samba was pre-trained with parameter sizes ranging from 421M to 3.8B.
- Samba was evaluated on benchmarks focusing on common sense reasoning, language understanding, truthfulness, and math and coding tasks.
- Samba consistently outperformed strong baselines like Llama, Mistol, Mamba, Gemma, and TFM Plus+.
- Experiments explored different hybridization strategies to find the most efficient architecture.
- Samba achieved the best average score on all benchmarks.
- The largest 3.8B Samba model demonstrated superior performance in language modeling tasks.
- Samba showed impressive results in benchmarks like MML, HumanEval, and GSM8K.
