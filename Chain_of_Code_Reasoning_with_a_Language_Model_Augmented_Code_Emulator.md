# SUMMARY
The authors introduce Chain of Code (COC), an approach enhancing language models' (LMs) code-driven reasoning by combining executable code and pseudo code for improved performance on complex tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Chain of Thought (CoT) breaks down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps.
- CoT is effective for semantic reasoning but struggles with numerical or symbolic reasoning.
- Researchers trained LMs to write and execute code to address numerical and symbolic reasoning.
- Code provides a structured way to build and encode complex programs.
- Writing a function to detect sarcasm in a string is a challenging task.
- Chain of Code (COC) enhances code-driven reasoning by simulating expected output of certain code lines.
- COC formats semantic subtasks as flexible pseudo code for LMs to emulate.
- COC combines benefits of executable code and pseudo code for semantic problems.
- COC outperforms popular methods on challenging numerical and semantic reasoning tasks.
- COC works well with both large and small models, unlike other techniques like CoT.
- In-context learning provides examples at inference time, allowing LMs to adapt quickly.
- CoT, Scratchpad, and Program of Thoughts leverage in-context learning to improve LM performance.
- CoT uses natural language for substeps, reflecting human thought processes.
- Scratchpad keeps track of intermediate steps when simulating code output.
- Program of Thoughts focuses on generating code to solve reasoning problems.
- COC generates reasoning substeps in the form of code, pseudo code, or natural language.
- COC uses Python's try and except to maintain program state during execution.
- COC intertwines code interpreter and LM simulator for complex reasoning tasks.
- COC performs exceptionally well on algorithmic tasks and on par with CoT on natural language tasks.
- COC achieves nearly 100% accuracy when code is repeated and run by Python.
- COC outperforms other methods in cross-task prompting with varied problem examples.
- Robotics applications benefit from COC's ability to interact with code-based interfaces and natural language.
- COC interweave version provides interpretability and detailed control for robotics tasks.
- Language models have made significant strides with few-shot prompting and abstract reasoning.
- Recent works propose techniques for LMs to use tools like calculators and code interpreters.
- LMs have been applied as programming assistants and shown capable of reasoning through code in new settings.
