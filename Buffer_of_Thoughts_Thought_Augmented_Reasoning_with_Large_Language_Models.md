# SUMMARY
The section discusses advanced techniques for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA. It introduces the Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) framework to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness by using shared high-level thoughts across tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Advanced techniques improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA.
- Single query reasoning focuses on prompt engineering to complete reasoning within a single query.
- Multi-query reasoning uses multiple LLM queries to explore different reasoning paths for complex problems.
- Single query reasoning often requires prior assumptions or specific examples, making it challenging to design.
- Multi-query reasoning can be computationally intensive due to recursive expansion of reasoning paths.
- Both methods may overlook deriving general guidelines or insights from past tasks.
- Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) aims to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of LLMs across various tasks.
- BoT includes a meta buffer storing universal high-level thoughts distilled from different problem-solving processes.
- A buffer manager dynamically updates the meta buffer as more tasks are solved.
- Shared thought templates adapt high-level thoughts to different tasks, enhancing reasoning accuracy.
- Thought augmented reasoning leverages historical reasoning structures to improve efficiency without complex multi-query processes.
- BoT mimics the human thought process, enabling consistent problem-solving and enhancing model robustness.
- Empirical studies show BoT significantly enhances precision, efficiency, and robustness across various tasks.
- BoT improves performance on challenging tasks like Game of 24, geometric shapes, and Checkmate in one.
- Retrieval augmented language models use external databases to enhance output quality and prompt-based reasoning techniques.
- Analogical reasoning is a valuable technique for natural language understanding achievable by LLMs.
- Problem distiller extracts important task details and constraints for better reasoning.
- Meta buffer contains high-level thoughts for different problems, improving LLM precision and flexibility.
- Thought templates are classified into categories like text comprehension, mathematical reasoning, and code programming.
- Instantiated reasoning retrieves a thought template for specific tasks or uses general templates if the task is new.
- Buffer manager stores distilled knowledge and thought templates, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in reasoning processes.
- Template distillation approach extracts general thought templates by summarizing core task challenges and designing solution steps.
- BoT outperforms previous prompting methods in accuracy across challenging benchmarks.
- BoT achieves comparable reasoning time to single query methods while being more efficient than traditional multi-query methods.
- Success rate metric assesses reasoning robustness, with BoT maintaining a higher success rate across tasks.
- Distribution analysis shows BoT effectively discovers appropriate templates for different benchmarks.
- BoT enables smaller models to match or outperform larger models, reducing inference cost for complex problems.
- Problem distiller plays a crucial role in extracting key information and constraints in complex problems.
- Meta buffer is important for addressing complex problems effectively in the BoT framework.
- Buffer manager enhances inference efficiency by retrieving suitable thought templates from the expanded meta buffer.
