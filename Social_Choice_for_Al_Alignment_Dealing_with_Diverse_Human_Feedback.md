# SUMMARY
The section discusses the role of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RHF) in enhancing large language models (LLMs) and the challenges it faces. It suggests integrating social choice theory to address these challenges and explores constitutional AI as an alternative approach.

# IDEAS:
- RHF is crucial for making LLMs more capable and controllable by aligning them with human values.
- Top AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google use RHF to align LLMs.
- Challenges in RHF include biased data, unrealistic human decision-making models, and limited human diversity representation.
- Social choice theory can help address RHF issues by determining whose preferences should influence decisions.
- LLMs trained solely on internet data may generate repetitive or harmful text.
- RHF allows models to follow instructions and produce useful, safe outputs based on human judgments.
- RHF involves collecting sample outputs from a pre-trained LLM and asking humans to choose the best ones.
- Constitutional AI involves humans creating a constitution outlining principles for guiding LLM training.
- Determining who contributes to the constitution and how it is formulated remains a challenge.
- Social choice tools can guide the design process towards fairer technical solutions in RHF.
- Applying social choice principles can determine valuable feedback and how to aggregate it effectively.
- A systematic approach can lead to a fairer system that considers input from a wider range of people.
- Concerns about inconsistency and feedback from diverse groups exist in RHF.
- Computational social choice is well established but its connection to aligning modern AI systems remains underexplored.
- Further research is essential to address the intersection of value alignment, RHF, and social choice effectively.
- Developing sound answers to these questions is crucial for building responsible AI systems.
- Ad hoc approaches may lead to systems that inadequately represent stakeholders or create conflicts.
- Value alignment ensures AI systems act in ways that align with human and societal values.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RHF) involves several steps including collecting preference data and training a reward model.
- Direct preference optimization (DPO) optimizes a model by directly working on the preference label dataset.
- Constitutional AI uses RL from AI feedback (RLA-AIF) techniques guided by a set of principles called a constitution.
- Social choice theory originated in the 1950s with Arrow's impossibility theorem.
- Arrow's theorem revealed that under certain conditions, the only feasible aggregation functions are dictatorship.
- Social choice rules can be applied to probability distributions, allowing evaluators to express preferences between distributions or plain alternatives.
- Multi-winner rules offer a compromise between deterministic single-winner rules and probabilistic approaches.
- Selecting a subset of the stakeholder population to provide feedback can be informed by social choice theory and statistical sampling methods.
- Human feedback can take various forms, such as open-ended comments, sorting responses, or ranking neural networks.
