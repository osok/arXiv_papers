# SUMMARY
The text discusses a new approach in computer vision using Generative Infinite Vocabulary Transformers (GVT) for image generation, which operates on sequences of real-valued vectors instead of discrete tokens, achieving better performance in image generation and dense prediction tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Transformers have become popular in computer vision by splitting images into patches.
- Standard approach involves embedding image patches linearly and feeding them to a Transformer encoder.
- Generative Transformers require discrete tokens from a fixed vocabulary, unsuitable for image generation.
- Two-stage approach uses vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and Transformer decoder.
- VQ-VAE maps images to discrete tokens; Transformer models the distribution of these tokens.
- Small vocabulary in VQ-VAE simplifies modeling but makes latent code less informative.
- Large vocabulary in VQ-VAE consumes memory and leads to low vocabulary utilization.
- Generative Infinite Vocabulary Transformer (GVT) operates on sequences of real-valued vectors.
- GVT predicts parameters of a continuous distribution over real-valued vectors.
- GVT trained with causal attention mask and teacher forcing.
- GVT matches or outperforms standard discrete token Transformer decoders.
- GVT uses Gaussian prior VAE to learn lower-dimensional latent space.
- GVT models sequences of real-valued vectors, called soft tokens.
- GVT replaces embedding lookup tables with a single linear layer.
- GVT predicts parameters of a continuous distribution using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
- GVT uses softmax activation for mixture probabilities and softplus for variance parameters.
- GVT causal predicts every vector conditioned on all previous vectors.
- GVT mask randomly masks input during training, gradually uncovering masked tokens during inference.
- Temperature sampling scales standard deviation of predicted Gaussian distributions.
- Nucleus sampling truncates predicted distributions per dimension for higher density support.
- Beam search maintains multiple beams, sampling candidates for each beam at each step.
- Density-based Classifier Free Guidance (DB-CFG) derived for GVT.
- DB-CFG involves training GVT with an additional null class for unconditional data distribution.
- DB-CFG uses rejection sampling to sample from unnormalized density derived from two GVT predictions.
- Experiments conducted on ImageNet dataset for image generation tasks.
- VAE setup uses ResNet blocks with 53.5 million parameters, replacing VQ layer with linear layer.
- GT models trained to predict single Gaussian distribution or mixture of distributions per dimension.
- GT models evaluated using FID, precision, recall, and representation learning capabilities.
- Panoptic segmentation and depth estimation tasks use UV framework with VQ-VAE replaced by beta VAE.
- GT encoder-decoder model uses cross-attention layer after each self-attention layer.
- Increasing KL term weight in VAE leads to worse reconstruction but better sampling quality.
- GT causal models outperform VQ-GAN in terms of FID despite having fewer parameters.

# INSIGHTS:
