# SUMMARY
Researchers analyze chains of thought (CoT) in language models, focusing on reasoning steps, prompt modifications, and their impact on decision-making.

# IDEAS:
- Researchers like Madon and Yasen Bash explored decomposition of prompts into symbols, patterns, and texts.
- Tang et al. investigated the role of semantics in CoT reasoning, uncovering reliance on pre-training.
- Wang et al. focused on the impact of demonstration selection in CoT, revealing relevance and order's importance.
- The study examines the relationship between reasoning steps and CoT prompting performance.
- Experiments systematically vary reasoning steps in CoT demonstrations while keeping other factors constant.
- The goal is to investigate how changes in reasoning structure influence the language model's decision-making.
- Researchers aim to expand and compress reasoning chains within CoT rationales without new task-relevant information.
- In zero-shot CAU, the initial prompt is modified to guide the model to engage in more extensive thinking.
- The refined strategy ensures a more comprehensive and detailed reasoning process, improving zero-shot performance.
- In few-shot CoT scenarios, reasoning chains are modified by adding or compressing reasoning steps.
- Strategies include thinking about the word, repeating the question, summarizing the current state, self-verification, and making equations.
- The goal is to examine how changes in reasoning structure influence the language model's decision-making.
- A quantitative analysis validates the effectiveness of prompt strategies on model performance.
- The research aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on CoT and its potential applications in language models.
