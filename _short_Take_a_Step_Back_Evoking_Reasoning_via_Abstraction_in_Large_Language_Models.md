# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "step back prompting" to enhance language models' reasoning by asking higher-level questions and grounding reasoning in retrieved facts.

# IDEAS:
- Step back prompting involves abstraction and reasoning to enhance language models' capabilities.
- Abstraction prompts the language model to ask higher-level questions about concepts related to the original question.
- Higher-level questions help retrieve relevant facts that aid in reasoning about the original question.
- Reasoning is grounded on facts obtained from high-level concepts or principles.
- This process is termed abstraction-grounded reasoning.
- Step back prompting helps avoid reasoning errors in intermediate steps.
- The approach is demonstrated through an empirical study on challenging tasks.
- The effectiveness of step back prompting is shown, though specific results are not provided.
- The method guides language models to ask higher-level questions and retrieve relevant facts.
- Grounding reasoning on these facts helps solve the original question effectively.
- The approach shows promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.
- The example given involves a physics question about ideal gas pressure and Estella Leopold's education history.
- The step back question encompasses the original question, aiding in information gathering.
- The method avoids direct addressing of the original question initially.
- The approach involves two key steps: abstraction and reasoning.
- The method is highlighted as avoiding reasoning errors in intermediate steps.
- The empirical study demonstrates the approach's effectiveness on challenging tasks.
- The specific improvements or modifications achieved are not explicitly mentioned.
- The main algorithm guides language models to ask higher-level questions.
- The approach retrieves relevant facts followed by reasoning based on those facts.
