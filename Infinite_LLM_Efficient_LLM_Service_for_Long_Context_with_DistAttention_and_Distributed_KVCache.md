# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the challenges and solutions for managing large language models (LLMs) in cloud services, focusing on resource allocation and memory management. It introduces "dist attention" and "disc KV LM" to optimize distributed computation and memory usage.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs are essential for AI applications but pose challenges due to their dynamic nature.
- Auto-regressive text generation generates one word at a time, complicating resource planning.
- Key Value (KV) Cache can exceed GPU memory limits, requiring resource reallocation.
- Paged attention swaps data between GPU and CPU memory but has limitations.
- Dist attention divides the KV cache into subblocks for better distributed computation.
- Disc KV LM coordinates memory usage among distributed GPUs and CPUs.
- Disc KV LM introduces a protocol for efficient interactions among LLM service instances.
- The system supports much longer context lengths and avoids performance issues.
- Evaluation shows performance improvements of 1.03 to 2.4 times over state-of-the-art work.
- LLMs like GPT-3 use Transformer models with multiple components for text generation.
- Data parallelism and model parallelism distribute the workload in LLMs.
- The context window in LLMs has grown from 2K to 256K in a year.
- Efficient memory pools are needed to handle long context lengths in LLMs.
- Traditional model parallelism leads to inefficient resource utilization.
- Dist attention enables independent model parallelism for attention layers.
- Disc KV LM manages KV cache memory across GPUs and CPUs in data centers.
- The G manager maintains global memory information across all instances.
- The dgfm algorithm optimizes memory allocation by recalling lent memory spaces.
- Dist attention reduces data transfer volume by sending query vectors to remote units.
- The system uses the Ray framework for distributed KV cache management.
- Evaluation shows disc KV LM supports context lengths 2 to 19 times longer than VM.
