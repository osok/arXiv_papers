- Auto-regressive text generation in LLMs generates one word at a time.
- Memory and computational resources for LLM services are unpredictable.
- Key Value (KV) Cache can exceed GPU memory limits, requiring resource reallocation.
- Paged attention swaps data between GPU and CPU memory but has limitations.
- Dist attention divides the KV cache into uniform subblocks for better management.
- Disc KV LM coordinates memory usage among distributed GPUs and CPUs.
- Disc KV LM introduces a protocol for efficient interactions among LLM service instances.
- Disc KV LM prioritizes data locality and communication optimization.
- The system supports much longer context lengths than previous methods.
- LLMs like GPT-3 use Transformer models with multiple components.
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism assigns importance to different input parts.
- LLMs predict the next token based on the input sequence.
- Data parallelism and model parallelism distribute LLM workloads.
- Model parallelism splits the model across multiple devices or nodes.
- Long context lengths in LLMs increase computational and memory needs.
- Efficient memory pools are needed for LLM services in data centers.
- Dist attention breaks down attention computation into smaller units.
- Disc KV LM manages KV caches across GPUs and CPUs in data centers.
- DGFM algorithm recalls lent memory spaces to optimize data locality.
