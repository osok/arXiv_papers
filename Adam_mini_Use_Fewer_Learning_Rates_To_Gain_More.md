# SUMMARY
The text discusses the development of Adam Mini, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large language models (LLMs). It aims to reduce memory usage while maintaining or improving performance compared to Adam.

# IDEAS:
- Atom Optimizer's high performance comes with significant memory costs.
- Memory overhead is a major obstacle in training massive models like Palm with 540 billion parameters.
- Developing a more memory-efficient optimizer can alleviate CPU offloading and reduce parameter sharding.
- Adam Mini simplifies the learning rate assignment process by partitioning model parameters.
- Adam Mini assigns a single learning rate to each block, leading to substantial memory savings.
- Adam Mini maintains or improves performance compared to Adam.
- Adam Mini is effective in terms of throughput and training time.
- Transformers require varying learning rates for different blocks due to their block diagonal Hess structure.
- A single optimal learning rate can be more efficient than multiple learning rates for dense subblocks.
- Adam Mini partitions model parameters into blocks, focusing on the EMB block for Transformers.
- Adam Mini reduces memory usage significantly for Transformers by reducing the number of learning rates.
- Adam Mini achieves higher throughput compared to Adam W, especially with limited hardware resources.
- Adam Mini does not conduct matrix factorization, allowing faster per-step updates.
- Default PyTorch partition works well for non-transformer tasks but not for Transformers.
- Partitioning queries and keys by heads stabilizes training and improves performance.
- Adam Mini performs similarly to Adam W but with lower memory usage for various LLMs.
- Adam Mini outperforms Adam W in downstream fine-tuning tasks like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
- Adam Mini achieves comparable or better performance than Adam W with lower memory usage in non-LLM tasks.
- Adam Mini saves around 45% to 50% of memory compared to Adam.
- There is potential to simplify Adam's heavy overhead in the future.

# INSIGHTS:
- Memory-efficient optimizers are crucial for training massive language models.
- Simplifying learning rate assignment can lead to substantial memory savings without compromising performance.
- Varying learning rates are essential for different blocks in Transformers due to their block diagonal Hess structure.
- A single optimal learning rate can sometimes outperform multiple learning rates for dense subblocks.
- Partitioning model parameters based on structure can enhance optimizer efficiency and performance.
