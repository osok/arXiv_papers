# SUMMARY
The text discusses the development of Adam Mini, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large language models (LLMs) like Palm. It aims to reduce memory usage and improve training efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- Atom Optimizer's high performance comes with significant memory costs due to optimizer state storage.
- Memory overhead is a major obstacle in training massive models like Palm with 540 billion parameters.
- Developing a more memory-efficient optimizer can alleviate CPU offloading and reduce parameter sharding.
- Adam Mini aims to enable LLM training with fewer GPUs, leading to cost and energy savings.
- Previous attempts like AdaActor have failed in reducing memory usage for large language models.
- Adam Mini reduces memory footprint by simplifying the learning rate assignment process.
- Partitioning model parameters based on the Hessian matrix structure allows for single learning rate assignment per block.
- Adam Mini maintains or improves performance compared to Adam while achieving higher throughput and efficiency.
- Transformers require varying learning rates for different blocks due to block diagonal Hessian structures.
- Experiments showed that fewer learning rates can sometimes outperform Adam in block diagonal Hessian problems.
- Adam Mini partitions model parameters into blocks, focusing on the EMB_block for Transformers.
- Simplified learning rate selection based on mean values streamlines the process while maintaining performance.
- Default PyTorch partitioning doesn't fully capture the structure of Transformers, causing training instability.
- Partitioning queries and keys by heads stabilizes training and enhances performance in Transformers.
- Adam Mini reduces memory usage significantly by reducing the number of learning rates.
- Higher throughput is achieved due to reduced communication overhead and minimal extra computation.
- Adam Mini does not conduct costly matrix factorization, allowing faster per-step updates.
- Experiments show substantial throughput increase with Adam Mini compared to Adam W when pre-training LLaMA 2 7B on GPUs.
- Potential for further improvement in learning rate design for dense Hessian subblocks exists.
- Adam Mini performs comparably to Adam W with lower memory usage across various LLM tasks.
- Sensitivity analysis shows Adam Mini is not highly sensitive to hyperparameters.
- Adam Mini outperforms Adam W in supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback tasks.
- Comparable or better performance than Adam W with lower memory usage in non-LLM tasks like ResNet18 and GCN training.

# INSIGHTS:
- Memory-efficient optimizers can make LLM training more accessible to researchers with limited GPU resources.
- Simplifying learning rate assignment can lead to substantial memory savings without compromising performance.
- Different blocks in Transformers require tailored learning rates due to their unique Hessian structures.
- Reducing the number of learning rates can sometimes outperform complex multi-rate approaches in optimization problems.
- Partitioning model parameters based on structure can stabilize training and enhance performance in Transformers.
- Streamlined learning rate selection processes can maintain performance levels while reducing memory usage.
- Higher throughput and efficiency can be achieved by minimizing communication overhead between GPUs and CPUs.
- Avoiding costly matrix factorization allows for faster per-step updates and reduced pre-training time.
- Sensitivity analysis indicates that Adam Mini is robust to hyperparameter variations.
- Memory-efficient optimizers like Adam Mini can benefit a wide range of tasks beyond LLM training.
