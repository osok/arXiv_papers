# SUMMARY
The proposed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RHF) framework aims to improve the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences by enhancing the stability and efficiency of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) through token-wise reward characterization.

- Focuses on improving stability and efficiency of training PPO, known to be unstable and sample inefficient.
- Develops token-wise reward characterization within an MDP formulation for precise understanding of LLMs.
- Extracts token-wise reward signals from offline preference data for RL training.
- Enhances PPO performance in RHF tasks, especially in dialog generation scenarios.
- RTO algorithm learns token-wise rewards based on preference data, optimizing through RL training.
- Constructs pessimistic token-wise reward estimation using a linear reward function via MLE.
- Token-wise reward calculated based on differences between preferred and non-preferred trajectories.
- Optimizes token-wise rewards through RL training methods like PPO.
- Assigns token-wise rewards to each token in response sequence for fine-grained optimization.
- Policy updated to maximize regularized value function defined with learned token-wise rewards.
- Leverages autoregressive nature of policies in LLMs for direct preference optimization.
- Token-wise MDP formulation offers significant advantage in exploration efficiency and sample complexity.
- Dense reward setting of token-wise rewards allows for more efficient exploration and learning.
