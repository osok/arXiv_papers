# SUMMARY
The proposed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RHF) framework aims to improve the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences by addressing the suboptimal performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The framework introduces a token-wise reward characterization within an MDP formulation to enhance training stability and efficiency.

- Token-wise rewards provide a more precise understanding of the LLM generation process.
- Extracting token-wise reward signals from offline preference data optimizes these rewards through RL training.
- RTO algorithm learns token-wise rewards based on preference data and optimizes them through RL training.
- Token-wise reward estimation uses a linear reward function learned through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
- Difference in rewards between preferred and non-preferred trajectories calculates token-wise rewards.
- Token-wise rewards enable a more fine-grained optimization process in RL training.
- Policy is updated to maximize the regularized value function defined with learned token-wise rewards.
