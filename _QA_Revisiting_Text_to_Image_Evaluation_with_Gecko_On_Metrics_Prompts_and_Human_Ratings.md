# SUMMARY
The paper presents a method to evaluate text-to-image (T2i) models' image-text alignment using a comprehensive benchmark called Gecko 2K, addressing prompt creation, human judgment collection, and auto-evaluation metrics.

# IDEAS:
- The proposed method aims to solve the evaluation of image-text alignment in T2i models.
- High-quality generated images may not fully capture all aspects of the text prompt.
- Gecko 2K consists of two subsets: Gecko R and Gecko S, tagged with skills.
- Gecko R is curated by resampling from existing datasets to improve skill distribution.
- Gecko S is a curated skill-based dataset with subskills to diversify prompts.
- Prompts in Gecko S focus on 12 skills in five categories: named entities, text rendering, language, relational action, spatial scale, and attributes.
- Human judgments are collected using different annotation templates like Lyer scale, Word level alignment, DSG, and side-by-side (SxS).
- The method identifies reliable prompts where annotators agree across models and templates.
- An auto AAL metric called Gecko improves question generation, filters hallucinated questions, and enhances VQA scoring.
- Gecko 2K offers a more comprehensive and discriminative evaluation of T2i models.
- Gecko 2K collates prompts across subskills for each skill, ensuring thorough evaluation.
- Gecko R extends existing benchmarks by improving skill distribution and lifting length limits.
- Gecko S generates prompts in a controlled manner for underrepresented skills.
- Gecko 2K gathers many annotations per image across multiple templates for reliable estimation.
- Comparing annotation templates shows the impact on model ordering and evaluation outcomes.
- Reliable prompts ensure consistency in model ordering across different evaluation scenarios.
- The Gecko metric achieves state-of-the-art results by improving existing auto-evaluation metrics.
- The Gecko metric enforces coverage of the prompt and filters out hallucinated questions.
- Normalizing VQA scores leads to more accurate and interpretable evaluations of T2i models.
- Different annotation templates lead to varying levels of inter-annotator agreement and data quality.
- SxS performs best on Gecko R subset, while Muse excels on Gecko S subset.
- Consistency in model ordering is observed on Gecko S but noisier on Gecko R.
- Ambiguous or hard-to-depict prompts led to the introduction of reliable prompts.
- Reliable prompts result in more consistent model ordering across templates.
- The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate annotation templates for evaluation.
- The design and background of annotators impact the selection of annotation templates.
- Resampling from existing datasets improves skill distribution in Gecko R.
- Lifting length limits on prompts addresses limitations in Gecko R prompt set.
- Gecko S focuses on generating prompts with subskills for a finer-grained analysis.
