# SUMMARY
The paper explores how self-replicators arise and dominate computational environments using various programming languages, focusing on spontaneous emergence and complex evolving behavior.

# IDEAS:
- The central question for the artificial life community is how self-replicators arise and dominate environments.
- The paper explores self-replicators in computational substrates like Brainfuck, Forth, Z80, and 8080 CPUs.
- Experiments focus on self-replicators emerging through self-modification with or without background mutation rates.
- The proposed method differs by studying the emergence of self-replicators from a pre-life period.
- Traditional approaches often study life after self-replicators are already abundant.
- Initializing random programs in environments without explicit fitness landscapes is a key difference.
- Self-replicators emerge primarily through self-modification and interactions among different programs.
- The method explores diverse computational substrates to observe self-replicator emergence.
- Novel complexity metrics like high-order entropy analyze the evolution of self-replicators.
- High-order entropy captures information from relations between characters rather than random noise.
- The primordial soup simulations demonstrate spontaneous emergence of self-replicators without handcrafted initial replicators.
- Programs self-modify and interact, leading to the rise of self-replicating entities.
- The length of self-replicators affects their likelihood of spontaneous emergence.
- BFF language relies on simple self-modification and interactions among programs.
- Forth language uses stack-based operations and more complex program structures.
- Self-replicators in Forth consist of a long non-functional head and a short functional replicating tail.
- The BFF language is minimalistic, leading to simple operations like copying and overwriting.
- Forth language exhibits more complex dynamics in the emergence of self-replicators.
- Self-replicators in Forth evolve to copy whole tapes and build upon existing replicators.
