# SUMMARY
The text discusses text embedding models, focusing on decoder-only models and introducing the lm2 VC method to enhance their performance in NLP tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Text embedding models convert natural language text into vector representations for various NLP tasks.
- Traditional models like BERT and T5 are commonly used for text embedding.
- Decoder-only models face limitations due to causal attention, restricting token interaction during encoding.
- Decoder-only models can learn from all input tokens during training, making them more efficient.
- Many tools and pre-training methods are available for decoder-only models, leading to continuous improvements.
- Some decoder-only models are good at following instructions, suitable for universal text embedding.
- lm2 VC is a simple unsupervised method to convert any pre-trained decoder-only model into a text encoder.
- lm2 VC involves bidirectional attention, masked next token prediction, and unsupervised contrastive learning.
- lm2 VC does not need labeled data and is efficient in terms of data and parameters.
- lm2 VC outperformed strong encoder-only models in tasks like chunking, named entity recognition, and part of speech tagging.
- Combining lm2 VC with supervised contrastive training achieved state-of-the-art performance among models trained on public data.
- Unsupervised contrastive learning (SimCSE) enhances sequence representations in decoder-only LLMs.
- SimCSE generates two different representations of the same input sequence through the model with independently sampled dropout masks.
- The model is trained to maximize similarity between these representations while minimizing similarity with other sequences in the batch.
- The three steps (bidirectional attention, masked next token prediction, SimCSE) form the lm2 VC recipe.
- Experiments with different decoder-only LLMs showed improved performance on word-level tasks.
- Causal attention is not optimal for constructing text embeddings; weighted mean pooling outperforms other methods.
- lm2 VC significantly improves performance on the MTE dataset, making it a state-of-the-art unsupervised model.
- Enabling bidirectional attention and training with the mntp objective helps distinguish between positive and negative examples.
- Bidirectional attention works effectively for Mistal 7B even without prior training.
- Combining lm2 VC with supervised contrastive learning improves performance and sample efficiency.
- Supervised text encoders have evolved through multi-stage learning processes involving large-scale weakly supervised training and multitask fine-tuning.
