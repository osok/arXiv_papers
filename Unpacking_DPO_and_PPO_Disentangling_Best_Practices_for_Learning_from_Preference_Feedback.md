# SUMMARY
This section explores the final training stage of modern language models (LMs) using preference feedback, focusing on PPO and DPO algorithms.

# IDEAS:
- Learning from preference feedback enhances performance in tasks like instruction following, coding, math, and summarization.
- PPO and DPO are two popular algorithms for preference-based learning in language models.
- PPO trains a reward model first, while DPO directly trains the main model.
- Quality of preferences, choice of learning algorithm, and size of reward model significantly impact performance.
- Synthetic diverse data with per-aspect preferences yields the best results for preference-based learning.
- PPO generally outperforms DPO across various data sets.
- Increasing the size of the reward model improves its performance but has limited impact on overall model performance.
- Tailored prompts during policy training can enhance performance in specific domains like math.
- DPO is more computationally efficient but PPO tends to outperform it in various scenarios.
- Evaluation covers a wide range of data sets assessing skills like factuality, reasoning, truthfulness, coding, safety, and instruction following.
- Synthetic data with per-aspect annotations outperforms human-annotated and web-scraped data sets.
- PO enhances reasoning, coding, and safety capabilities more than DPO.
- PPO-trained models show improved Chain of Thought reasoning abilities even without specific examples.
- Scaling up training data and increasing model size do not always lead to significant enhancements in overall performance.
- Targeted prompt distributions can enhance performance when combined with powerful reward models.
- Using prompts from the GSM train set with 70 billion reward models leads to significant improvements in GSM performance.
- Weaker reward models struggle with prompts that differ from their training set.
- Training with the 13 billion Ultra feedback reward model performs worse with non-Ultra feedback prompts.
- Mixed prompts do not necessarily enhance performance in a general setting.
- Ultra feedback is already diverse, achieving strong performance in math and coding evaluations.
- Shifting The Prompt distribution away from other tasks slightly impacts overall performance negatively.

# INSIGHTS:
- Preference feedback is crucial for enhancing language model performance in various tasks.
- Synthetic diverse data with per-aspect preferences yields superior results over human-annotated data.
- PPO generally outperforms DPO despite being less computationally efficient.
- Tailored prompts can significantly improve performance in specific domains like math.
- Larger reward models improve performance but have limited impact on overall model effectiveness.
- Evaluating over diverse tasks is essential to understand the impact of reward model size and training.
- Targeted prompt distributions enhance performance when aligned with powerful reward models.
- Mixed prompts do not consistently improve general performance, indicating the importance of task-specific prompts.
