# SUMMARY
The section explores the final training stage of modern language models (LLMs) using preference feedback, focusing on PPO and DPO algorithms.

# IDEAS:
- Learning from preference feedback enhances models like ChatGPT, LLaMA 3, and Claude.
- PPO and DPO are two popular algorithms for preference-based learning.
- PPO trains a reward model first, while DPO directly trains the model.
- Quality of preferences and choice of learning algorithm are crucial for model performance.
- Synthetic diverse data with per-aspect preferences yields the best results.
- PPO generally outperforms DPO across various data sets.
- Increasing the size of the reward model improves its performance but has limited impact on overall model performance.
- Tailored prompts during policy training can enhance performance in specific domains like math.
- DPO is more computationally efficient but generally outperformed by PPO.
- Evaluation covers a wide range of data sets and considerations.
- Synthetic data with per-aspect annotations outperforms human-annotated and web-scraped data sets.
- PPO enhances reasoning, coding, and safety capabilities more than DPO.
- Models trained with PPO show improved Chain of Thought reasoning abilities.
- Scaling up reward model size does not always lead to significant downstream performance improvements.
- Targeted prompt distributions can enhance performance when combined with powerful reward models.
- Using mixed prompts does not necessarily enhance performance in a general setting.
- Ultra feedback is already diverse, achieving strong performance in math and coding evaluations.
- Shifting prompt distribution away from other tasks slightly impacts overall performance negatively.
- Reward models do not generalize well to unseen prompts.
- Larger reward models perform better when training prompts closely match test settings.
- Weaker reward models struggle with prompts differing from their training set.
- Tailored prompts for specific tasks like math can lead to significant improvements.
