# SUMMARY
The text discusses enhancing large language models (LLMs) for long document question answering by combining context compression and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This approach extends the effective context window of a 4K LLaMA 2 to 7B model to handle up to 128K tokens, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens and faster processing speed.

- The user prompt is processed normally, and the LLM generates answers based on summary embeddings and user prompts.
- The pipeline for offline context learning consists of pre-processing, fine-tuning, and serving stages.
- Documents are divided into chunks, and summary embeddings are generated during pre-processing.
- Fine-tuning involves grouping documents based on their type or tasks users want to perform.
- Serving retrieves compressed token embeddings of passages and applies the corresponding LoRA adapter to the decoder LLM.
