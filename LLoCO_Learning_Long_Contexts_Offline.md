# SUMMARY
The text discusses enhancing large language models (LLMs) for long document question answering by combining context compression and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This approach extends the effective context window of a 4K LLaMA 2 to 7B model to handle up to 128K tokens, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens and faster processing speed.
