# SUMMARY
The paper introduces advancements in Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMT) to enhance memory utilization and processing efficiency for long sequences.

# IDEAS:
- Enhancing RMT capabilities through methodological advancements improves memory utilization and processing efficiency for long sequences.
- Processing input segments with a memory state from the previous step updates memory and yields predictions.
- Recurrent processing of segments significantly improves context size, allowing linear scaling with input size.
- The approach demonstrates strong performance on sequences up to 16,000 tokens, outperforming GPT-4 in efficiency.
- Implementing a self-retrieval mechanism employs cross-attention between past states and the previous memory state.
- Self-retrieval allows the model to access information from earlier segments, enhancing performance on longer sequences.
- Concatenating retrieved states with the previous memory state maintains consistent performance on sequences up to 128,000 tokens.
- Marginal quality degradation observed even with extended sequences, demonstrating enhanced memory and prediction capabilities.
- Introducing RMT with self-retrieval where retrieved states serve as input for the RMT backbone Transformer.
- Persistent performance improvements observed over extremely long sequences, even up to 10 million tokens.
- Memory state in RMT consists of memory tokens that independently retrieve relevant tokens from previous states.
- Mechanism akin to multiple heads in Transformers attention allows for linear scaling with input size.
- Storage and computational overhead for RMT scales linearly with input length, enabling efficient inference.
- Efficient inference on sequences up to 10 million tokens without encountering limitations.
