- Concatenating retrieved states with the previous memory state maintains consistent performance up to 128,000 tokens.
- Marginal quality degradation observed even with sequences extending up to 128,000 total tokens.
- Introduced RMT with self-retrieval where retrieved states are concatenated to read memory only.
- Persistent performance improvements observed over extremely long sequences up to 10 million tokens.
- Memory state in RMT consists of memory tokens that independently retrieve relevant tokens from previous states.
- Mechanism akin to multiple heads in Transformers attention, allowing linear scaling with input size.
- Storage and computational overhead for RMT scales linearly with input length.
