# SUMMARY
A proposed NL to code model combines encoder-decoder architecture with diffusion process, outperforming autoregressive models in diversity and syntactic correctness across three languages.

# IDEAS:
- Autoregressive code generation models struggle to reconsider previously generated tokens.
- Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in image generation and are now extended to text.
- Embedding layers convert discrete tokens into continuous embeddings for diffusion models.
- Projecting embeddings back to tokens independently can result in invalid programs in code generation.
- Combining encoder-decoder architecture with diffusion process improves NL to code generation.
- Encoder maps natural language into continuous representation for diffusion model denoising.
- Denoised embeddings are fed to a decoder using full self-attention and cross-attention.
- Continuous paragraph denoising (CPD) task is extended to the code domain.
- CPD task applies noise to tokens corresponding to identifiers or built-in keywords.
- The system produces 48.5% more syntactically correct generations compared to Genie.
- Evaluated on Python, Bash, and conditional formatting rules in Microsoft Excel.
- System's top one results are comparable or better than larger state-of-the-art systems.
- System outperforms all baselines in top three and top five categories.
- Unsupervised pre-training of denoiser and decoder using code snippets.
- Supervised fine-tuning of encoder, denoiser, and decoder using utterance-code snippet pairs.
- Loss function includes minimizing error between predicted and actual noise.
- Iteratively remove noise from input during inference to produce final predicted code.
- Evaluated using various metrics: template match for Bash, score metric for Python, execution match for Excel.
- System produces more diverse outputs compared to autoregressive models.
- System's outputs are more often syntactically valid compared to other diffusion models.
- Removing pre-training tasks significantly reduces performance.
- Gradual refinement shows normalized string edit distance decreases with time.
