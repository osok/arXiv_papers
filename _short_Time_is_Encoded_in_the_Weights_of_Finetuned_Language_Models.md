- Use LM adaptation objective to reduce computational burden during fine-tuning.
- Employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to merge weights back into the base model.
- Explore different ways of interpolating between time vectors to generalize to new times.
- Compute interpolation between two time vectors through a weighted sum of the vectors.
- Evaluate performance of interpolated models on intervening times by sweeping over weights.
- Measure temporal misalignment across various domains, tasks, and time scales.
- Analysis reveals linear patterns of degradation in each task for all model sizes yearly.
- Monthly scale analysis shows nonlinear patterns corresponding to the cycle of months.
- Analyze weights of time-specific models and use time vectors to update models to unseen times.
- Weights of time vectors become less similar as fine-tuning times become more misaligned.
- Use time vector analogies to update models to intervening future and multiple time periods.
- Interpolating between time vectors improves performance on unseen intervening and future times.
- Building a multi-year model using a soup of time vectors performs worse than fine-tuning on all times.
