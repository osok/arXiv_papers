# IDEAS:
- H2O danu 1.8B is a language model with 1.8 billion parameters trained on 1 trillion tokens.
- The model is based on foundational ideas from Llama 2 and Mistol, fine-tuned for efficiency.
- Despite fewer training tokens, H2O danu 1.8B performs well across a wide range of benchmarks.
- A chat model version has been developed, improved through supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.
- Advanced language models use decoder attention architecture, benefiting from pre-training on large text datasets.
- Performance improves with larger model sizes, more data, and greater computational power for training.
- Smaller models are important for efficiency on consumer hardware and specific tasks.
- H2O danu 1.8B adopts key principles from Llama 2 and Mistol, trained on diverse data excluding coding data.
- The model architecture includes a hidden size of 2560, intermediate size of 6912, and 24 hidden layers.
- Uses the original Llama 2 tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000 and context length of 16,384 tokens.
- Features include a sliding window approach for local attention with a fixed window of 4,096 tokens.
- Rotary positional embedding (RoPE) helps the model understand the position of elements in a sequence.
- Grouped query attention reduces memory usage with 32 attention heads and eight key-value heads.
- Root mean square layer normalization (RMS Norm) ensures stable training without bias in linear layers.
- Training used a single node with 8 H100 GPUs employing distributed data parallel (DDP).
- Experimented with smaller data and model sizes to find optimal training settings and hyperparameters.
- Training sequences increased from 248 to 16,384 tokens using a total of 700 billion tokens.
- Utilized 8-bit floating point calculations to speed up training with certain layers in FP8 precision.
- Used AdamW optimizer with specific beta values and cosine learning rate scheduler for training stability.
- Achieved an average throughput of 292.50 tokens per second on a single node during training.
- H2O danu 1.8B is openly available under the Apache 2.0 license, making large language models more accessible.
- The chat model variant was trained with supervised fine-tuning on conversational input-output pairs.
- Direct preference optimization (DPO) was used for further fine-tuning with various data sets.
- Evaluated against benchmarks like common sense reasoning, world knowledge, and reading comprehension.
- Outperformed most competitors except for Stable LM2 in several areas despite fewer training tokens.
