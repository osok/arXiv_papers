# SUMMARY
The paper investigates how Transformers achieve compositional generalization using multi-head attention, introducing a novel hyper Network decomposition to enhance understanding and performance.

# IDEAS:
- The paper aims to understand how Transformers achieve compositional generalization to unseen scenarios.
- Focuses on how Transformers perform gradient-based optimization within sequences.
- Investigates the structure of latent code in multi-head attention models.
- Introduces a novel decomposition of multi-head attention as a hyper Network.
- Hyper Network reconfigures computation of another neural network in a data-dependent manner.
- Decomposition aims to provide insights into how Transformers learn and generalize.
- Method decomposes multi-head attention into a hyper Network perspective.
- Each head forms a linear hyper Network with key-query specific inputs.
- Hyper Network configures computation of another neural network in a data-dependent manner.
- Attention scores along the head index represent a compact code for key-query pairs.
- Shared hyper Network supports reuse and recombination of learned operations.
- Introduces Hyper Network Linear Attention (HILA) as a modification of standard multi-head attention.
- HILA makes the value network nonlinear and normalizes the latent code along the head index.
- HILA reinforces the hyper Network mechanism without adding additional parameters.
- Method tests models' ability to generalize to unseen rule combinations by splitting rule combinations into train and test sets.
- Scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization on tasks like SReN.
- Structured latent code clusters according to task rules, aiding in finding correspondences.
- Theoretical benefit: novel decomposition allows composition of value networks specific to key-query pairs.
- Practical benefit: HILA offers simple modification leading to better compositional generalization on abstract reasoning tasks.
- Method validated through fuzzy logic task and symbolic abstract reasoning task (SReN).
- Fuzzy logic task requires in-context learning to study compositional generalization.
- SReN task based on Raven Progressive Matrices, predicting final query panel contents.
- HILA outperformed standard multi-head softmax attention and linear attention on abstract reasoning tasks.
- More expressive value network in HILA enhances inductive bias towards compositionality.
- Structured latent code analysis shows attention scores form functionally structured space.
- Clusters in latent codes correspond to functions underlying each task.
- Limitations: focus on models trained from scratch, not large-scale pre-trained models.
- Preliminary experiments show HILA improves over linear attention but falls short of softmax attention.
