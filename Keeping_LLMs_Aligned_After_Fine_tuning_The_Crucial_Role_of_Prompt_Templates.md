# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the importance of prompt templates in maintaining the safety and alignment of fine-tuned language models. It highlights that using different templates during fine-tuning and inference significantly reduces safety loss while improving performance.

# IDEAS:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for new applications in research and commercial endeavors.
- Open-source models like Llama 2 can be fine-tuned using personal resources or proprietary APIs.
- Alignment training ensures models understand and follow user instructions while providing useful responses.
- Safety training aims to handle problematic queries by refusing assistance or providing constructive feedback.
- Fine-tuning on benign datasets does not guarantee the model remains safe for public use.
- Prompt templates are key to maintaining safety during both fine-tuning and inference phases.
- Using the same prompt template for both phases can harm safety alignment.
- Different templates for fine-tuning and inference significantly reduce the attack success rate (ASR).
- Prompt Template Safety Tuning (PTST) is the most effective strategy for maintaining model safety.
- Adding safety examples during fine-tuning can nearly eliminate ASR but may not cover all unsafe queries.
- PTST remains effective even when safety examples are included in the fine-tuning process.
- Training and test templates might be the same or different, impacting model performance and safety.
- An attacker can submit harmful queries using the test template without knowing the model's internal workings.
- A sophisticated language model like GPT-4 can assess the harmfulness of responses on a scale from one to five.
- Jailbreaking techniques can manipulate unmodified public language models to respond to harmful queries.
- Direct Harm 4 dataset consists of queries known to elicit higher ASRs in many fine-tuning scenarios.
- Using chat mode templates generally exhibits better safety than text mode templates.
- Pure Tuning Safe Testing (PTST) preserves safety without significantly sacrificing helpfulness.
- PTST outperforms early stopping, a common technique to prevent overfitting during training.
- Experiments with GPT 3.5 Turbo and Mistal models show similar trends to Llama 2.
- Switching to a specific template like Chat Llama for inference reduces harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness.
- Consistency in safety prompts during fine-tuning and testing is crucial for preserving model safety.
- Adding safety examples into training can significantly lower ASR on similar queries without PTST.
- Fine-tuning with PTST shows promising results in reducing ASR, especially with different templates for training and testing.
- Prompt engineering aligns LLMs with human values, enhancing safety through combined instructions and context examples.
- Fine-tuning on a small amount of harmful data can bypass safety guardrails, leading to safety degradation.
- Fine-tuning with benign data can also result in safety degradation, highlighting alignment challenges.
