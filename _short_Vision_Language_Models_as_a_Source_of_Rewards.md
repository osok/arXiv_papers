# SUMMARY
The paper discusses computing the probability of an agent achieving a goal using language descriptions and current states, applying softmax over cosine similarity with the CLIP model.

# IDEAS:
- Compute probability of goal achievement using language description and current state.
- Apply softmax over cosine similarity between state and language description embeddings.
- Use CLIP model to compute cosine similarity for each potential goal.
- Apply softmax with temperature parameter to obtain goal achievement probability.
- Convert probability into binary reward by thresholding with a hyperparameter.
- Reward set to one if probability exceeds threshold, zero otherwise.
- Sample negative examples uniformly from task set for consistent rewards.
- Use fixed negatives throughout training to avoid stochastic rewards.
- Provide stable training signal using fixed negatives.
- Use reward model in partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) setting.
- Agent receives observations, takes actions, observes next state, and receives rewards.
- Episode terminates on timeout or goal achievement according to intrinsic reward function.
- Reward model consists of image encoder and text encoder in POMDP setting.
- Assume no access to ground truth reward during training, only for evaluation.
- Intrinsic reward function determines episode termination based on goal achievement.
- Use intrinsic reward function for agent's decision-making process.
- Evaluate agent's performance using ground truth reward post-training.
- Intrinsic reward function provides feedback based on agent's actions and observations.
- Use language descriptions to guide agent's goal achievement process.
- Employ temperature parameter in softmax to control probability distribution.
