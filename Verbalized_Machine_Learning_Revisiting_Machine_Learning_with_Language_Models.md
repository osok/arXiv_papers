# SUMMARY
The text discusses the concept of Verbalized Machine Learning (VML), where pre-trained language models are used as function approximators parameterized by natural language prompts, enhancing interpretability and automatic model selection.

# IDEAS:
- VML uses natural language to define machine learning models and train them iteratively.
- Pre-trained language models serve as function approximators parameterized by text prompts.
- VML offers interpretability and automatic model selection during learning.
- Natural language prompts parameterize functions in VML, injecting inductive bias.
- VML treats both data and model parameters as part of the text prompt.
- The optimizer LLM generates next-step model parameters based on current parameters, training data, and loss function.
- VML provides a straightforward way to incorporate inductive bias using human-interpretable language.
- Each model update in VML is fully interpretable, explaining the reasoning behind updates.
- VML's unified representation of data and model at the token level enhances interpretability.
- VML can solve classical machine learning problems using text prompts without prior training.
- VML framework includes formulating algorithms with text prompt templates and empirical studies on verbalized inductive bias.
- VML allows for easy tracing of model failures due to its strong interpretability.
- Empirical evidence shows that model parameters describe underlying patterns in a language format.
- Freezing a pre-trained language model treats it as a deterministic or probabilistic function.
- Optimizing model parameters in VML involves updating the model's language characterization.
- The optimizer in VML offers automatic model selection and detailed explanations for updates.
- VML's natural language space is discrete, sequential, and human-interpretable.
- VML can uncover new knowledge that humans can benefit from due to its interpretability.
- VML resembles the Von Neumann architecture by storing both data and model parameters in the text prompt.
- VML effectively solves regression and classification tasks by determining optimal model parameters.
