# SUMMARY
The paper explores decoding strategies in the pre-trained Palm 2 model, comparing greedy decoding with alternative paths to enhance Chain of Thought (CoT) methods.

# IDEAS:
- Greedy decoding often bypasses the Chain of Thought (CoT) method, tackling problems directly.
- The model's training on simpler questions skews its perception of problem complexity.
- CoT paths naturally emerge when considering alternative top K tokens in decoding.
- Analyzing logits helps identify paths based on probability differences between decoding routes.
- CoT decoding sifts through various paths to pinpoint those embodying a CoT approach.
- Selecting the most appropriate decoding path involves considering length or normalized probability score.
- Preference for longer paths is introduced when probabilities are closely matched.
- Aligning continuations with specific spans in the decoding path enhances accuracy in reasoning tasks.
- Experimenting with branching at later stages enriches the diversity of potential decoding paths.
- Early branching significantly increases the variety of paths explored.
- Aggregating answers across all decoding paths using a weighted method bolsters result stability.
- Maximizing the sum of probability differences across paths pinpoints the most likely correct answers.
- Sampling methods are comparatively inefficient in uncovering correct CoT paths.
- Sampling often results in incorrect final answers unlike the CoT decoding procedure.
- The initial step in decoding is crucial for determining the variety of explored paths.
- The ninth most likely token can reveal valid CoT paths in the GSM 8K question set.
- The model's behavior at the initial decoding step is pivotal for CoT emergence.
- Systematic extraction of CoT paths involves analyzing logits and probability differences.
- Refining answer span identification within responses improves accuracy in reasoning tasks.
- Weighted aggregation of answers enhances stability and correctness of results.
- Alternative decisions at each step (K > 0) reveal notable trends in model behavior.

# INSIGHTS:
- Greedy decoding bypasses CoT due to training on simpler questions, affecting problem complexity perception.
- CoT paths emerge naturally with alternative top K tokens, enhancing problem-solving approaches.
- Analyzing logits and probability differences is key to identifying effective CoT paths.
- Early branching in decoding significantly diversifies potential solution paths.
- Weighted answer aggregation maximizes stability and correctness in results.
