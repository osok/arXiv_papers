- Reasoning steps are hypothesized to be the most critical component of CoT prompts.
- Strong correlation exists between the length of the reasoning chain and LLM capabilities.
- Misleading information in the reasoning chain can still improve performance.
- Few-shot CoT shows a direct linear correlation between reasoning steps and accuracy.
- Incorrect reasoning steps can lead to positive results if they maintain required inference length.
- Benefits of increasing reasoning steps depend on task complexity.

- In-context learning incorporates input-output examples directly into the prompt.
- CoT improves understanding of complex questions and their underlying logic.
- Auto-CoT automates the CoT process for better efficiency.
- Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework allows models to consider multiple reasoning paths.
- Decomposition of prompts into symbols, patterns, and texts affects CoT.
- Semantic knowledge from pre-training is crucial for CoT reasoning.
- Relevance and order of reasoning are more important than accuracy in CoT.
