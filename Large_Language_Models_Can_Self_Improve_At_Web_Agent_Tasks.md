# SUMMARY
The text discusses enhancing large language models (LLMs) in complex multi-step tasks using self-improvement techniques, including fine-tuning on synthetic data and unsupervised methods like self-critique.

# IDEAS:
- Self-improvement techniques can enhance LLMs in complex multi-step tasks involving environment interaction.
- Traditional prompting methods are insufficient for LLMs in complex tasks due to lack of suitable training data.
- Acquiring data for multi-step tasks is time-consuming and expensive, making evaluation challenging.
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting can improve LLM performance without additional supervised training data.
- Self-critique or feedback from interactions with tools or environments aids LLM self-improvement.
- Effectiveness of self-improvement in long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step interactions is not well understood.
- Fine-tuning LLMs on their own generated data can improve performance in complex tasks.
- Unsupervised methods like self-critique help filter training examples for better fine-tuning.
- New metrics introduced to evaluate LLM self-improvement include capability acquisition and trajectory quality.
- Synthetic training examples for multi-step tasks can be collected without ground truth labels.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data leads to performance improvements, especially on benchmarks like Web Arena.
- Different synthetic data mixtures enhance performance, with the best mixture showing a 31% improvement.
- Auxiliary metrics help understand the effects of self-improvement on model performance and trajectory quality.
- Plausible trajectories from Web Arena tasks are used for fine-tuning without needing ground truth labels.
- Base models can create new tasks, objectives, web pages, and solution trajectories for training.
- Diversity and generalization are ensured by generating out-of-domain synthetic examples.
- Web Arena environment is seen as a partially observable Markov decision process.
- Functional correctness is a basic metric indicating task completion correctness.
- Capability score assesses an agent's ability to solve unique capabilities rather than just task completion.
- Vertex score evaluates trajectory quality by comparing node distributions within a computational graph.
- Dynamic time warping aligns trajectories of different lengths for fair comparison.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data mixtures improves overall performance, with mixture B showing the most improvement.
- Self-improved agents acquire new capabilities but may lose some existing ones.
- Training on out-of-domain synthetic examples enables unique capabilities not seen in other models.
- Longer trajectories and more invalid actions are trade-offs observed in some fine-tuned models.
- Successive rounds of self-improvement show diminishing returns in performance enhancement.
- Human or supervised filtering could mitigate reinforcement of incorrect actions and biases.
