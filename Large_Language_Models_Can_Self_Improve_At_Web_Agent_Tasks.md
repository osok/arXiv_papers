# SUMMARY
The text discusses enhancing large language models (LLMs) in complex multi-step tasks using self-improvement techniques, including fine-tuning on synthetic data and unsupervised methods like self-critique.

# IDEAS:
- Self-improvement techniques can enhance LLMs in complex multi-step tasks requiring environment interaction.
- Traditional prompting methods are insufficient for LLMs in complex tasks due to lack of suitable training data.
- Acquiring training data for multi-step tasks is time-consuming and expensive.
- Evaluating model performance on each step of a sequence is challenging.
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting can improve LLM performance without additional supervised training data.
- Self-critique or feedback from interactions with tools or environments aids LLM self-improvement.
- Effectiveness of self-improvement in long-horizon tasks with multi-step interactions is not well understood.
- Fine-tuning LLMs on their own generated data can improve performance in complex tasks.
- Unsupervised methods like self-critique filter training examples for better fine-tuning.
- New metrics introduced to evaluate self-improvement impact: capability acquisition and trajectory quality.
- Synthetic training examples for multi-step tasks can be collected without ground truth labels.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data leads to performance improvements, especially on the Web Arena Benchmark.
- Best synthetic data mixture resulted in a 31% improvement on the Web Arena Benchmark.
- Auxiliary metrics help understand self-improvement effects on model performance and trajectory quality.
- Plausible trajectories without detectable failures are used for fine-tuning without ground truth labels.
- Base model can create new tasks, objectives, web pages, and solution trajectories for training.
- Diversity and generalization are ensured by generating out-of-domain synthetic examples.
- Web Arena environment is seen as a partially observable Markov decision process.
- Agent model used is the qw1.5 to 72b chat model, known for competitiveness and accessibility.
- In-domain synthetic training examples are structured as intent, observation, previous action, leading to next action.
- Out-of-domain synthetic data generation uses in-domain examples as seeds for new tasks and solutions.
- Functional correctness is a basic metric indicating task completion correctness in the Web Arena Benchmark.
- Capability score assesses an agent's ability to solve unique capabilities rather than just task completion.
- Vertex score evaluates trajectory quality by comparing node distributions within a computational graph.
- Dynamic time warping aligns trajectories of different lengths for fair comparison in vertex score.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data mixtures improves overall performance, with mixture B showing the most significant improvement.
- Self-improved agents acquire new capabilities but may lose some existing ones.
- Fine-tuning on mixtures A and B maintains most base agent model capabilities after self-improvement.
- Training on out-of-domain synthetic examples enables unique capabilities not seen in other agent models.
- Longer trajectories and more invalid actions observed in some fine-tuned models indicate trade-offs in quality.
