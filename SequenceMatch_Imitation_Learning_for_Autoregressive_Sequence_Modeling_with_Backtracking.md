# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the challenges and solutions in training auto-regressive models like GPT for text generation. It introduces "sequence match," an imitation learning approach to improve model performance by minimizing chi-square divergence and incorporating a backspace function for error correction.

# IDEAS:
- Auto-regressive models like GPT can suffer from degeneration in free-form text generation.
- Compounding errors in auto-regressive models lead to out-of-distribution sequences.
- Sequence match minimizes chi-square divergence between real data and generated sequences.
- Sequence match includes a backspace function to correct errors in generated text.
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is commonly used but has limitations.
- KL Divergence measures the difference between model and data distributions.
- KL Divergence does not optimize model recovery from mistakes.
- Chi-square divergence penalizes out-of-distribution behavior more effectively.
- Sequence modeling can be viewed as a Markov decision process (MDP).
- Occupancy measures help evaluate the likelihood of sequences and actions.
- Minimizing occupancy divergences aligns model behavior with real data.
- Entropy regularization helps solve the divergence minimization problem.
- Q function and Bellman operators are key in reformulating the optimization problem.
- Logits parameterize policies, simplifying the optimization process.
- Practical implementation involves generating samples during training.
- Backspace actions require preprocessing sequences into valid states.
- Augmenting data with backspace examples improves model performance.
- Text degeneration occurs due to overestimating out-of-distribution tokens.
- Top-K and Top-P sampling methods mitigate text degeneration.
