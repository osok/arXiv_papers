# SUMMARY
The text discusses methods to extract detailed information from large language models (LLMs) using common API configurations, focusing on the low-rank output layer. These methods enable efficient retrieval of full outputs, model identification, and monitoring of updates, enhancing trust and accountability in LLMs.

# IDEAS:
- Analyzing the low-rank output layer in LLMs reveals a restricted output space called the LLM's image.
- The LLM's image can be obtained by collecting a small number of LLM outputs.
- Innovative algorithms enable efficient extraction of the LLM's image using standard API configurations.
- Understanding the LLM image opens up various possibilities for different applications.
- LLM images can serve as unique signatures to identify model outputs accurately.
- These signatures are sensitive to minor changes in LLM parameters, useful for inferring model updates.
- No straightforward solution exists to prevent LLM image extraction without altering the architecture.
- Providers may consider hiding this information, but API features have essential uses for clients.
- Methods serve as a reminder for providers to consider the impact of their model architectures and APIs.
- Fast and complete outputs from API-protected LLMs can be obtained using a common API feature.
- The proposed algorithm requires 43 API calls to obtain one full output accurately.
- An enhancement theoretically achieves full outputs in 45 API calls but faces numerical instability issues.
- A numerically stable algorithm retrieves full outputs in 47 API calls.
- A practical algorithm handles stochastic APIs, gathering complete outputs in less than 49 API calls.
- Pre-processing steps reduce the number of API calls from 50 to 18, speeding up the process significantly.
- The objective is to extract a comprehensive next-token distribution from an API-protected LLM.
- The approach enables acquiring the full distribution in 45 API calls by querying with maximally biased tokens.
- Numerical instability due to exponential growth is addressed with a more stable strategy.
- Stochastic APIs introduce randomness; modeling this behavior helps collect full probabilities in 49 API calls.
- Pre-processing steps leveraging low-dimensional LLM output space lead to significant speed improvements.
- Five linearly independent outputs form a basis for the entire output space, reducing queries to 18.
- The embedding size of API-protected LLMs can be determined by collecting linearly independent outputs.
- Monitoring changes in embedding size and parameter count over time is crucial for tracking updates.
- The image of an LLM is distinct for different models or checkpoints, allowing precise identification.
- Small parameter changes greatly affect the LLM image, enabling model identification without exact inputs.
- Sensitive LLM images help detect minor and major updates to API-protected LLMs.
- Detecting LoRA updates by analyzing LLM outputs before and after the update is possible.
- Identifying unar maxable tokens using only the LLM's image without full access to the softmax matrix is feasible.
- Recovering the softmax matrix from outputs involves assuming embeddings lie near a hypersphere surface.
- Improved LLM inversion techniques leverage knowledge of the LLM's image for efficient decoding algorithms.
- Potential mitigations include restricting API access to log probs or transitioning to architectures without a softmax bottleneck.
- Methods enhance trust between LLM API users and providers by enabling efficient model auditing protocols.
