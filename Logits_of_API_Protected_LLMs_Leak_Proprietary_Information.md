# SUMMARY
The text discusses methods to extract detailed information from large language models (LLMs) using common API configurations. It covers algorithms for obtaining full outputs, identifying model updates, and recovering the softmax matrix, enhancing trust and accountability in LLMs.

# IDEAS:
- Analyzing the low-rank output layer in LLMs reveals a restricted output space called the LLM's image.
- The LLM's image can be obtained by collecting a small number of LLM outputs.
- Innovative algorithms enable efficient extraction of the LLM's image using standard API configurations.
- Understanding the LLM image opens possibilities for various applications, including determining embedding size.
- LLM images serve as unique signatures to identify model outputs accurately.
- These signatures are sensitive to minor changes in LLM parameters, useful for inferring model updates.
- No straightforward solution exists to prevent LLM image extraction without altering the architecture.
- Providers may consider hiding this information, but API features have essential uses for clients.
- Methods serve as a reminder for providers to consider the impact of their architectures and APIs.
- Algorithms can obtain fast and complete outputs from API-protected LLMs by leveraging token logit biasing.
- The proposed algorithm requires 43 API calls to obtain one full output accurately.
- An enhanced algorithm theoretically achieves full outputs in 45 API calls but faces numerical instability.
- A numerically stable algorithm retrieves full outputs in 47 API calls.
- A practical algorithm handles stochastic APIs, gathering complete outputs in less than 49 API calls on average.
- Pre-processing steps reduce the number of API calls from 50 to 18, significantly speeding up the process.
- The objective is to extract a comprehensive next-token distribution from an API-protected LLM.
- By querying the API with maximally biased tokens, unbiased probabilities for each token can be derived.
- The method enables acquiring the full distribution in 45 API calls.
- Numerical instability due to exponential growth is addressed with a more stable strategy.
- Stochastic APIs like OpenAI's introduce randomness; modeling this behavior helps collect full probabilities.
- Pre-processing steps leveraging low-dimensional LLM output space lead to significant speed improvements.
- Five linearly independent outputs form a basis for the entire output space, reducing queries to 18.
- The additive log-ratio transform manipulates columns of the output matrix to determine embedding size.
- Monitoring changes in embedding size and parameter count over time is crucial for tracking updates.
- The image of an LLM is distinct for different models or checkpoints, allowing precise identification.
- Small parameter changes greatly affect the LLM image, useful for detecting updates and holding providers accountable.
- Sensitive LLM images help detect minor and major updates, including parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA.
- Access to the LLM's image enables identifying unar maxable tokens that the model cannot output due to constraints.
- Recovering the softmax matrix involves assuming embeddings lie near a hypersphere surface with small radius.
- Improved LLM inversion techniques leverage knowledge of the LLM's image for efficient decoding algorithms.
- Potential mitigations include restricting API access to log probabilities or transitioning to architectures without a softmax bottleneck.
- Methods enhance trust between LLM API users and providers by enabling efficient model auditing protocols.
