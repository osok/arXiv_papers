# SUMMARY
The paper discusses large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models, focusing on open-source LLMs and multimodal tasks involving images and videos.

# IDEAS:
- Open-source LLMs like LLaMA, Vonia, Alpaca, and LLaMA 2 emulate human AI conversations.
- InstructGPT is a model trained on GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters aligned with human preferences.
- Extending LLMs to multimodal tasks involves images and videos.
- Scheduler-based methods treat LLMs as plug-and-play modules for various visual models.
- Decoder-based methods align image tokens to the LLM input through linear projection layers.
- MiniGPT-4 and MPL Owl are examples of decoder-based approaches.
- Video LLaVA framework uses language bind encoders to extract features from visual signals.
- Visual features are mapped into the textual feature space for a unified visual representation.
- Shared projection layers combine visual features with tokenized textual queries to generate responses.
- The goal is to map images and videos into a shared feature space for unified learning.
- Language bind modality encoders align images and videos with the textual feature space.
- Video LLaVA's training pipeline is similar to that of a large language model.
- The model maximizes likelihood probability for multimodal understanding capabilities.
- Video LLaVA interprets visual signals within an extensive image-video-text pair dataset.
- The training objective is the original autoregressive loss for basic vision abilities.
- The model generates responses based on different instructions and requests.
- Vonia 7B version 1.5 is used as the large language model in Video LLaVA.
- Visual encoders are derived from language bind initialized from ViT-L14.
- The text tokenizer is sourced from LLaMA with approximately 32,000 classes.
- Shared projection layers consist of two fully connected layers.
- Understanding pre-training uses a subset of 558k Layon CCbu image-text pairs and 702k video-text pairs.
- Instruction tuning uses instructional datasets from LLaVA version 1.5 and Video ChatGPT.
- Video LLaVA achieves top performance on eight out of nine image understanding benchmarks.
