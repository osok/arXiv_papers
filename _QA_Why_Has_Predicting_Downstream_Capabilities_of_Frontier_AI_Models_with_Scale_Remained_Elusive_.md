# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the challenges in modeling scaling behavior on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks due to the unpredictability introduced by fluctuations in probability mass on incorrect choices.

# IDEAS:
- Modeling scaling behavior on multiple-choice benchmarks is challenging due to reliance on metrics like accuracy and Brier score.
- Transformations from raw model outputs degrade the statistical relationship between metrics and scaling parameters.
- The challenge arises from modeling both concentration and fluctuations of probability mass on correct and incorrect choices.
- Metrics like accuracy and Brier score are influenced by probability mass fluctuations on incorrect choices.
- Negative log likelihood of the correct choice is calculated as a function of compute.
- Probability mass of the correct choice is computed with respect to the model's vocabulary.
- Probabilities are constrained to available choices by masking invalid continuations and normalizing.
- Normalized probability masses are used to compute downstream metrics like accuracy and Brier score.
- Fluctuations in probability mass on incorrect choices significantly impact predictability of performance metrics.
- Metrics depend on how probability mass concentrates on correct choices and fluctuates on incorrect choices.
- The unpredictability stems from underdetermined values of probability mass for each incorrect choice.
- Predicting downstream performance requires understanding how probability mass fluctuates on incorrect choices.
- Probability mass on incorrect choices introduces unpredictability in performance evaluations of AI models.
- Distribution of remaining mass among incorrect choices impacts final metric scores.
- Fluctuation in probability mass on incorrect choices introduces variability in performance metrics.
- Probability masses on correct and incorrect choices coary positively with increasing compute.
- Fitting per sample scaling trends for each incorrect choice might enable prediction of change points in metrics.
- Spread of predictions varies significantly, making accurate extrapolation challenging.
- Future evaluations should consider fluctuations in probability mass on incorrect choices.
- Per sample scaling trends for each incorrect choice should be considered for accurate performance predictions.
- Importance of considering impact of probability mass on incorrect choices in evaluation design.
