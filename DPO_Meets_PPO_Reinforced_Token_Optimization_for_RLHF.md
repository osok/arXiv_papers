# SUMMARY
The text discusses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its role in aligning large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude with human values. It introduces Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO) to address inefficiencies in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

# IDEAS:
- RLHF aligns LLMs with human values and preferences.
- Traditional RLHF uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
- PPO training can be unstable and inefficient compared to supervised learning.
- Mismatch between RLHF as a bandit problem and PPO's multi-step token-wise rewards.
- Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO) focuses on token-wise rewards.
- RTO uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for token-wise reward signals.
- RTO outperforms existing methods in dialogue tasks.
- Rejection sampling fine-tuning builds on the best-of-n inference concept.
- Conditional SFT avoids explicit reward learning.
- Direct Preference Learning skips the reward modeling step.
- DPO treats the language model itself as a reward model.
- DPO achieves competitive ranking accuracy compared to traditional reward functions.
- Theoretical studies on RLHF trace back to dueling bandit and dueling reinforcement learning.
- Existing reward maximization frameworks lead to deterministic optimal policies.
- Reverse KL constrained contextual bandit problem formulation for RLHF.
- Token-wise MDP formulations optimize token-wise rewards efficiently.
- RTO leverages token-wise reward functions to enhance PPO performance.
- Bradley-Terry (BT) model calculates preference probability between responses.
- KL regularized term balances reward optimization and staying close to a reference policy.
- Token-wise MDP offers advantages over sentence-wise bandit by distinguishing sparse and dense rewards.
- Sample complexity refers to responses and rewards needed to find the optimal response.
- RTO algorithm learns token-wise rewards from preference data.
- Practical implementation of RTO involves calculating token-wise rewards.
