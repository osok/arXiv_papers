# SUMMARY
The text discusses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its role in aligning large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude with human values. It introduces Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO) to address inefficiencies in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by leveraging token-wise rewards.

- Mismatch between sentence-level rewards and token-wise rewards affects PPO performance.
- Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO) focuses on token-wise rewards for better LLM responses.
- RTO uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for token-wise reward extraction.
- RTO surpasses existing methods in dialogue tasks by optimizing token-wise rewards.
- Classical RLHF involves reward training from human feedback and reward-based RL training.
- Rejection sampling fine-tuning builds on the best-of-n inference concept.
- Direct Preference Learning skips the reward modeling step in RLHF.
- DPO treats the language model itself as a reward model.
- Theoretical studies on RLHF trace back to dueling bandit and dueling reinforcement learning concepts.
- Existing reward maximization frameworks lead to deterministic optimal policies.
