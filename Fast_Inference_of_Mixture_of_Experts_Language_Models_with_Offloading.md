# SUMMARY
The content discusses recent advancements in natural language processing driven by large pre-trained language models and the challenges of using open-access models due to their size. The authors propose techniques for running large mixture of experts (Mo) language models with limited GPU memory, focusing on efficient offloading strategies and quantization to enable interactive token generation on affordable hardware.

# IDEAS:
- Large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 and 4 drive recent NLP progress.
- Open-access models like LLaMA, Falcon, and Bloom allow local modifications.
- These models require multiple high-end GPUs due to their enormous size.
- Compressing model parameters or offloading them to cheaper storage can help.
- Sparse mixture of experts (Mo) blocks modify Transformer architecture for efficiency.
- Mo blocks use a gating function to decide which experts to use for input.
- Efficient training is achieved as only a small portion of experts are used per pass.
- Techniques for efficient language model inference often perform suboptimally on Mo models.
- The goal is to run large Mo language models with limited GPU memory.
- Observations show some experts are reused between adjacent tokens.
- Early layers' hidden states know which experts to use at subsequent layers.
- A Mo-specific offloading strategy reduces GPU RAM communication and speeds up generation.
- Mixed quantization and offloading algorithms enable interactive token generation on desktop hardware.
- Mo models build on the idea of training ensembles of specialized models.
- The gating function selects the best experts for the task during training.
- Mo models improve perplexity and learn interpretable expert specialization.
- Mo models are cheaper to train and infer but require more parameters than dense models.
- Pre-trained Mo LLMs have been available for over a year but gained less traction.
- Mixtal AI's sparse Mo models achieve near state-of-the-art performance but need high-end GPUs.
- Quantization, sparsification, and factorization reduce model size for efficiency.
- Offloading model parameters to cheaper memory can handle large models with limited GPU memory.
- Interactive inference generates tokens one at a time, slowing down offloading.
- Expert locality and LRU caching speed up inference for Mo LLMs.
- Speculative expert loading guesses likely next experts to reduce latency.
- Practical design considerations include caching, prefetching, and expert quantization.
- Experiments test assumptions about Mo models' behavior and compare inference speed.
- LRU caching and speculative loading improve expert recall during inference.
- Different quantization schemes affect Mo performance and size trade-offs.
- Evaluated setups generate two to four tokens per second with proposed techniques.
