# SUMMARY

The discussion focuses on optimizing large mixture of experts (Mo) language models for limited GPU memory, proposing offloading strategies and quantization techniques to enable efficient token generation on affordable hardware.

# IDEAS:

- Large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 and 4 drive recent NLP progress.
- Open Access models like LLaMA, Falcon, and Bloom allow local modifications.
- These models require multiple high-end GPUs due to their enormous size.
- Compressing model parameters or offloading to cheaper storage can help.
- Sparse mixture of experts (Mo) blocks modify Transformer architecture.
- Mo blocks contain layers or experts and a gating function for input selection.
- Efficient training uses only a small portion of experts per forward pass.
- Techniques for efficient language model inference often perform suboptimally on Mo models.
- The goal is to run large Mo language models with limited GPU memory.
- Observations show some experts are reused between adjacent tokens.
- Early layer hidden states know which experts to use in subsequent layers.
- A Mo-specific offloading strategy reduces GPU RAM communication.
- Speculative expert loading guesses needed experts ahead of time.
- Mixed quantization and offloading algorithms enable interactive token generation.
- Mo models build on training ensembles of specialized models with a gating function.
- Mo models improve perplexity and learn interpretable expert specialization.
- Mo models are cheaper to train but require more parameters than dense models.
- Pre-trained Mo LLMs are openly available but less used due to size.
- Quantization reduces model size but presents challenges with transformer-based LLMs.
- Best compression rate for most LLMs is 4 bits per parameter.
- Offloading parameters to cheaper memory works well for large batch processing.
- Interactive inference generates tokens one at a time, slowing offloading.
- Expert locality and LRU caching speed up inference for Mo LLMs.
- Speculative expert loading can reduce latency by guessing next experts.
- Practical design includes caching, prefetching, and expert quantization.
- Experiments test caching, pre-loading, and quantization schemes for Mo models.
- Evaluations show setups can generate 2-4 tokens per second with full algorithm.
