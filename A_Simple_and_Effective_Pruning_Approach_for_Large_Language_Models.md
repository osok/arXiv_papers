# SUMMARY
The discussion focuses on the impact of large language models (LLMs) on natural language processing (NLP). It introduces Wanda, a novel pruning technique that reduces computational demands without retraining.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) have extraordinary capabilities but require significant computational resources.
- Model quantization converts parameters into smaller bit-level representations, resulting in substantial resource savings.
- Network pruning reduces model size by setting specific weights to zero, but often requires retraining.
- Sparse GPT is a recent LLM pruning method that doesn't require retraining but still demands heavy computation.
- Magnitude pruning doesn't perform well on LLMs with low levels of sparsity.
- Wanda prunes LLMs to high degrees of sparsity without modifying remaining weights.
- Wanda's pruning metric combines weight magnitude and input activations for effective weight importance evaluation.
- Wanda can be performed in a single forward pass and requires minimal memory overhead.
- Wanda outperforms magnitude pruning and matches or exceeds sparse GPT while requiring lower computational resources.
- Emergent large magnitude features are unique to transformer-based LLMs and critical for predictive power.
- Removing outlier features drastically declines the language model's performance.
- Wanda's pruning metric uses the product of weight magnitude and the norm of corresponding input activations.
- Wanda compares weights locally within each output of linear layers for effective pruning.
- Wanda can be adapted for structured n:m sparsity, where at most N out of every M contiguous weights are non-zero.
- Wanda simplifies weight importance computation, eliminating the need for matrix inverses.
- Wanda is 300 times faster than sparse GPT in practice.
- Wanda doesn't need weight updates after pruning, suggesting precise sparse subnetworks in LLMs.
- Wanda performs better than magnitude pruning and on par with or better than sparse GPT in unstructured sparsity.
- Wanda adapts well to structured sparsity, frequently outperforming baseline methods.
- Wanda's results are similar to sparse GPT but simpler and more efficient computationally.
- Wanda is competitive with baseline methods in zero-shot tasks, especially for specific tasks like HellaSwag and OpenBook QA.
- Wanda's pruning speed is faster than sparse GPT, useful for real-time pruning needs.
- Wanda's default configuration delivers the best pruned model with a perplexity of 7.26.
- Wanda's performance isn't overly reliant on the exact selection of calibration data.
- Incorporating OBS weight update process doesn't improve the pruned model obtained by Wanda.
- Wanda outperforms magnitude pruning in image classification tasks at high sparsity levels.
- Retraining can mitigate accuracy differences between pruned networks, suggesting Wanda's suitability for non-retraining scenarios.
