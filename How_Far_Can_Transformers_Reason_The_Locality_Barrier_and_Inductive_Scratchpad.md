# SUMMARY
The text discusses the challenges Transformers face in complex reasoning tasks like syllogism composition and the cycle task. It introduces concepts like distribution locality and scratch pads to improve learning efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- Transformers excel in some reasoning tasks but struggle with complex logic or mathematics.
- Syllogism composition involves inferring new knowledge by combining existing knowledge efficiently.
- Transformers struggle to efficiently learn syllogism composition on graphs with randomly drawn edges.
- The complexity of learning increases exponentially as the graph size grows.
- The cycle task requires global reasoning, making it difficult for Transformers.
- Subset parities also challenge Transformers due to the need for global reasoning.
- A general complexity measure is needed to explain why certain tasks are hard for Transformers.
- Scratchpad methodologies could potentially overcome these challenges.
- Distribution locality quantifies the minimum number of tokens needed to correlate with the target.
- Efficient weak learning by a regular Transformer is possible only if distribution locality is constant.
- The cycle task serves as a benchmark to assess models' global reasoning abilities.
- Agnostic scratch pads cannot break the locality barrier in learning tasks.
- Educated scratch pads introduce autoaggressive locality to break task locality.
- Inductive scratch pads leverage induction for tasks like cycle, arithmetic, or parity tasks.
- Inductive scratch pads improve both locality and out-of-distribution generalization.
- Locality is a clear measure applicable to any data distribution without needing to infer a distribution class.
- T-regular neural networks have limitations in computing functions based on their depth and scratch pad size.
- Scratch pads can reduce the locality of learning, making it easier for models to learn sequences.
- Inductive scratch pads can handle more reasoning steps than those encountered during training.
- Inductive scratch pads can facilitate length generalization for tasks like parity and addition.
