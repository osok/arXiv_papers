# IDEAS:
- Enhancing LLMs' mathematical skills during feedback learning phase improves practical deployment.
- Math critique model derived from LLM provides feedback on generated solutions.
- Rejective fine-tuning (RFT) involves multiple sampling iterations rejecting certain responses.
- Direct preference optimization (DPO) updates the model by learning from pairs of correct and incorrect answers.
- MAURV Benchmark evaluates LLMs on complex real-world mathematical problems.
- Self-critique pipeline enhances both mathematical and linguistic abilities simultaneously.
- Math critique assesses mathematical responses by scoring them based on questions and reference answers.
- Math critique uses explanatory analysis inspired by thought chains to improve scoring accuracy.
- Math critique classifies responses into four categories: entirely incorrect, partially correct, mostly correct, and completely correct.
- Average score evaluation calculates the mean of critique scores for a set of questions.
- Hard split evaluation categorizes answers as passing or failing based on correctness threshold.
- Self-critique pipeline reduces manual annotation efforts and enhances model efficiency.
- DPO method is advantageous due to its simplicity in handling data flows, stability, and speed during training.
- DPO training pairs are constructed based on significant differences in math critique scoring results.
- DPO data set includes sampled questions, chosen answers, and rejected answers.
