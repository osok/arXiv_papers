# SUMMARY
The paper evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) using a simple Common Sense reasoning task called the Alice in Wonderland (AIW) problem.

# IDEAS:
- The AIW problem tests LLMs' ability to perform basic reasoning using Common Sense Logic.
- The task involves determining how many sisters Alice's brother has.
- The method highlights significant breakdowns in reasoning abilities of most state-of-the-art LLMs.
- Despite high performance on standardized benchmarks, LLMs struggle with the AIW problem.
- The method exposes models to AIW problem variations to assess correct response rates.
- Observations include reasoning failures, overconfidence in wrong solutions, and nonsensical explanations.
- The paper investigates models' inability to revise wrong solutions.
- Performance on a harder version of the AIW problem, AIW plus, is also tested.
- The method sheds light on discrepancies between claimed reasoning capabilities and actual performance.
- The correct solution involves adding the number of sisters Alice has to one.
- Models are prompted with different AIW problem variations and asked for final answers.
- Responses are evaluated to determine correct response rates using a beta binomial distribution.
- Variance and mean of the probability of a correct response are calculated.
- Models are tested with at least 30 trials for each AIW variation and prompt type.
- Results show most LLMs struggle with the AIW problem, except for GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus.
- The method includes testing models on a harder version, AIW plus, revealing significant performance breakdowns.
- Analysis includes overconfidence, confabulations, and inability to revise wrong solutions.
- The method provides insights into LLMs' reasoning capabilities and highlights discrepancies with standardized benchmarks.
- The paper calls for reassessment of how LLMs are tested and compared.
- The method urges the development of more challenging benchmarks for accurate assessment.
- Model responses were evaluated by instructing them to provide final answers in a specific format.
- Correct response rates were estimated and compared using beta binomial distribution calculations.
- Different prompt types were used to observe variations in model responses.
- Results show severe breakdown in reasoning capabilities of most LLMs with the AIW problem.
- GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus achieved higher correct response rates than other models.
- AIW plus led to stronger performance collapse across all tested models.
- Overconfidence in wrong solutions and generation of confabulations were highlighted.
- Inability to revise wrong solutions even when prompted was observed.
- Limitations include lack of diversity in AIW problem variations used for evaluation.
- Future work should address limitations by implementing systematic procedural instance generation.

# INSIGHTS:
- LLMs struggle with basic Common Sense reasoning despite high standardized benchmark scores.
- The AIW problem reveals significant discrepancies in LLMs' claimed reasoning capabilities.
- Overconfidence and confabulations highlight LLMs' inability to assess solution quality accurately.
- Testing with harder problems like AIW plus exposes limitations of even the strongest models.
- Systematic procedural instance generation is needed for broader evaluation of model responses.
