# SUMMARY
The paper discusses integrating CSS into HTML by scraping website links, refining data, and benchmarking models for web design automation.

# IDEAS:
- Integration of CSS code into HTML files enhances efficiency in web design automation studies.
- Scraping website links from the C4 validation set creates single code implementation files.
- Automatic filtering based on length and layout criteria ensures quality and manageability.
- Excluding examples with over 100k tokens refines the data set.
- Filtering out web pages consisting solely of images or text improves data quality.
- The refined data set contains 14K web pages after deduplication.
- Removing external dependencies and replacing media files with placeholders makes web pages standalone.
- Manual curation process involved inspecting 7K examples and annotating 200 examples.
- Achieving a 75% agreement rate in manual curation ensures high-quality data.
- Filtering out low-quality web pages results in 484 high-quality test examples for benchmarking.
- Data statistics analysis assesses difficulty levels and diversity within the data set.
- Multimodal prompting methods and fine-tuning an open-source model were employed for evaluation.
- Comparing performance against commercial API models and other open-source baselines establishes a comprehensive benchmark.
- Evaluation process includes automatic and human assessments focusing on visual similarity and element matching metrics.
- Analysis reveals significant findings regarding webpage difficulty and model learning processes.
- Correlations between automatic metrics and difficulty indicators help understand model improvement.
- Qualitative analysis highlights the effectiveness of text-augmented and self-revision prompting methods.
- Text-augmented prompting improves content recall, while self-revision fixes layout errors.
- Study compares the design 2 code 18b model with other baselines.
- Future directions for web design automation and programming support tools are discussed.
- Findings contribute valuable insights into current models' capabilities and limitations.
