# SUMMARY
The paper discusses integrating CSS into HTML by scraping website links, refining data, and evaluating models for web design automation.

# IDEAS:
- Integration of CSS code into HTML files enhances efficiency in web design studies.
- Scraping all website links in the C4 validation set creates single code implementation files.
- Automatic filtering based on length and layout criteria ensures quality and manageability.
- Excluding examples with over 100k tokens refines the data set.
- Filtering out web pages consisting solely of images or text improves data quality.
- The refined data set includes 14K web pages after deduplication.
- Removing external dependencies makes web pages standalone.
- Replacing media files with placeholders maintains the original layout for benchmarking.
- Manual curation process involved inspecting 7K examples and annotating 200 examples.
- Achieving a 75% agreement rate in manual curation ensures high-quality data.
- Filtering out low-quality web pages results in 484 high-quality test examples.
- Data statistics analysis assesses difficulty levels and diversity within the data set.
- Multimodal prompting methods evaluate the effectiveness of various models.
- Fine-tuning an open-source model, design 2 code 18b, for the task.
- Comparing performance against commercial API models and other open-source baselines.
- Evaluation includes automatic and human assessments focusing on visual similarity.
- Element matching metrics and direct comparisons to reference examples are used.
- Significant findings regarding webpage difficulty and model learning processes.
- Correlations between automatic metrics and difficulty indicators explored.
- Qualitative analysis highlights effectiveness of text-augmented and self-revision prompting.
- Text-augmented prompting improves content recall.
- Self-revision prompting fixes layout errors effectively.
- Study compares design 2 code 18b model with other baselines.
- Future directions for web design automation and programming support tools discussed.
- Findings contribute valuable insights into current models' capabilities and limitations.
