# SUMMARY
The text discusses the challenges in understanding deep neural networks (DNNs) and introduces explainable AI (XAI) to make DNNs' decision-making understandable. It focuses on mechanistic interpretability and introduces a novel evaluation framework called COZY for assessing open vocabulary explanations for neurons in computer vision models.

# IDEAS:
- Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make DNNs' decision-making processes understandable to humans.
- Initial XAI efforts focused on explaining local decisions of DNNs using saliency maps.
- Mechanistic interpretability describes specific concepts neurons detect, enhancing global model explainability.
- Textual descriptions of neurons have evolved from label-specific to complex, open vocabulary explanations.
- Lack of a universally accepted quantitative evaluation measure for open vocabulary neuron descriptions is a challenge.
- Different methods use their own evaluation criteria, complicating comprehensive comparisons.
- COZY is a novel quantitative evaluation framework for open vocabulary explanations in computer vision models.
- COZY leverages generative AI to generate synthetic images aligned with textual explanations.
- Synthetic images help evaluate how neurons differentiate between concept-related and control images.
- Activation maximization identifies input signals that trigger the highest activation in a neuron.
- Automatic neuron interpretation links neurons with human-understandable concepts through textual descriptions.
- Network dissection and compositional explanations associate neurons with concepts based on activation maps.
- COZY uses metrics like area under the receiver operating characteristics (AU) and mean activation difference (MAD).
- Generative models convert textual neuron explanations into visual images for evaluation.
- Experiments show detailed prompts with SDXL result in the highest similarity to natural images.
- Synthetic images slightly activate neurons more than natural images, but the difference is minimal.
- COZY consistently shows high scores for true explanations and low scores for random ones.
- Milan, Invert, and CLIP Dissect are recent methods for providing textual explanations of neurons.
- CLIP Dissect defines concept labels using common English words and dataset labels.
- Invert achieved the highest AU scores overall except for ResNet18 on ImageNet.
- CLIP Dissect consistently showed good results across models and datasets.
- Milan had poor performance with an average AU below 0.65 due to abstract explanations.
- Lower layer neurons encode lower-level concepts, while later layers indicate higher concept quality.
- Falcon scored the lowest, even below random performance, in explanation quality.
