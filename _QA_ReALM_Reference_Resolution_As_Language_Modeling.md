# SUMMARY
The paper discusses a method for reference resolution in conversational agents, focusing on on-screen entities. It highlights the limitations of end-to-end approaches and proposes a fine-tuned language model for improved performance.

# IDEAS:
- The proposed method addresses reference resolution in conversational agents, focusing on on-screen entities.
- Understanding context, including references like "they" or "that," is crucial for natural communication.
- Enhancing user experience by allowing queries about on-screen elements enables true hands-free interaction.
- End-to-end approaches fall short in scenarios with limited computing power or API integration.
- Smaller language models fine-tuned for reference resolution improve interpretability and modularity.
- Reconstructing the screen using parsed entities and their locations aids reference resolution.
- Traditional pipeline approaches are valuable for efficiency, privacy, and integration with existing systems.
- The method generates a textual representation of the screen content for the language model.
- Tagging screen entities provides context around their locations and associated text.
- The large language model (LLM) performs reference resolution on both conversational and on-screen entities.
- On-screen entities are currently displayed on the user screen.
- Conversational entities are relevant to the conversation from previous turns or the virtual assistant.
- Background entities come from background processes not directly visible on the screen.
- Reference resolution is posed as a multiple-choice task for the LLM.
- The LLM extracts relevant entities from on-screen, conversational, and background entities.
- The model outputs relevant entities in any order, including "none of these."
- The Mars system is a non-LLM approach for reference resolution.
- ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) predicts a list of entities from a set available.
- The proposed model, Realm, uses a fine-tuned LLM (FLA-T5) for reference resolution.
- Realm outperforms Mars and ChatGPT in various datasets.
- Realm's approach involves providing parsed input to the model and fine-tuning it.
- Shuffling entities before feeding them to the model prevents overfitting to specific positions.
- Larger models improve performance, especially in on-screen data sets.
- On-screen reference resolution is more complex, requiring larger models for better performance.
- Realm performs almost as well as GPT-4 on on-screen datasets despite being smaller.
- Realm's textual encoding approach achieves competitive performance with GPT-4.
- Performance gains are notable in on-screen datasets, indicating task complexity.
- Realm and GPT-4 have similar performance on unseen domains.

# INSIGHTS:
