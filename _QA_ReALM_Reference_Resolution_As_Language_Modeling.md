# SUMMARY
The paper presents a method to improve reference resolution in conversational agents, focusing on on-screen entities. It advocates for smaller, fine-tuned language models over end-to-end approaches.

# IDEAS:
- The proposed method addresses the need for reference resolution in conversational agents.
- Focuses on resolving references to on-screen entities in addition to conversational and background entities.
- Highlights the importance of understanding context, including references like "they" or "that."
- Aims to enhance user experience by allowing queries about on-screen elements.
- Enables true hands-free interaction with voice assistance.
- Emphasizes limitations of end-to-end approaches in real-world scenarios.
- End-to-end models are infeasible on devices with limited computing power.
- Traditional pipeline approach is valuable for efficiency, privacy, and integration with existing systems.
- Advocates for smaller language models fine-tuned for reference resolution.
- Improves interpretability and modularity in handling different types of entities.
- Overcomes challenges in encoding on-screen entities for reference resolution.
- Reconstructs the screen using parsed entities and their locations.
- Generates a textual representation that aids the language model in resolving references.
- Handles reference resolution by tagging parts of the screen that are entities.
- Provides context around where entities appear and the text surrounding them.
- Allows the large language model (LLM) to see entities on the screen and understand their properties.
- Task of reference resolution is posed as a multiple-choice task for the LLM.
- Extracts relevant entities from on-screen, conversational, and background entities.
- Compares proposed model (REALM) to Mars system and ChatGPT variants.
- REALM uses a fine-tuned LLM (FLAN-T5) for reference resolution.
- REALM outperforms Mars and ChatGPT in various datasets.
- Key difference between Mars and REALM is the use of LLMs.
- Shuffling entities before feeding them to the model prevents overfitting to specific positions.
- Larger models perform better on complex on-screen reference resolution tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
- Smaller, fine-tuned language models can outperform larger end-to-end models in specific tasks.
- Traditional pipeline approaches offer advantages in efficiency, privacy, and system integration.
- Reconstructing screen content into textual representation aids in effective reference resolution.
- Shuffling entities enhances model generalization and prevents overfitting to specific positions.
- Larger models are better equipped to handle complex on-screen reference resolution tasks.
