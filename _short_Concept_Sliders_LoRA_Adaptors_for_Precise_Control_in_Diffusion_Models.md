# SUMMARY
The paper discusses diffusion models, their training process, and low-rank adapters (LoRA) for efficient adaptation of large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models synthesize data by reversing a diffusion process.
- Training involves adding noise to data and then denoising it to generate an image.
- Low-rank adapters efficiently adapt large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks.
- Diffusion models transition data from an organized state to complete Gaussian noise.
- The noised image is modeled using randomly sampled Gaussian noise and additional inputs.
- The objective is to reverse the process by predicting true noise from the input image.
- LoRA decomposes weight updates into smaller matrices, reducing trainable parameters.
- Pre-trained weights are frozen, and smaller matrices are optimized in LoRA.
- During inference, weight updates can be merged into pre-trained weights with no overhead.
- LoRA scaling factor is used to merge weight updates during inference.
- Concept sliders method fine-tunes LoRA adapters on diffusion models for targeted image control.
- The goal is to modify models to increase or decrease the likelihood of certain attributes.
- Low-rank parameter directions control the expression of specific attributes.
- Text or image pairs are used as supervision for optimizing specific global directions.
- Small paired before-after image datasets train sliders for nuanced visual concepts.
- Sliders capture visual concepts through contrast between image pairs.
- Training optimizes LoRA applied in both negative and positive directions.
- Concept sliders can be defined through custom artwork.
- Latents from other generative models can be transferred using this approach.
- The method improves control and editing capabilities of generative models.
- Training low-rank subspaces optimizes for specific global directions.
- Precise and localized editing of semantic attributes is achieved.
- Fine-tuning LoRA adapters uses text or image pairs as supervision.
