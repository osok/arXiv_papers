# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the major barrier to the wide deployment of latent diffusion models (LDMs) in real-world applications, focusing on their low sampling efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- LDMs rely on multi-step sampling to produce high-quality outputs, leading to low sampling efficiency.
- The 50-step DDIM sampling process ensures output quality but requires long latency on modern mobile devices.
- Single-shot generative models like GANs bypass iterative refinement, resulting in lower operational latency.
- Efficiency optimization in LDMs is crucial for enhancing their practical applications.
- Recent advancements focus on faster network architectures and improved sampling algorithms to reduce inference time.
- Diffusion distillation techniques simplify the process by learning multi-step sampling results in a single forward pass.
- Smaller models have not received adequate attention despite efforts to improve sampling efficiency.
- Diffusion distillation leverages redundant learning capability in LDMs for enhanced efficiency.
- Smaller models maintain competitive performance against larger distilled models when sampling budgets are constrained.
- The empirical focus is on how LDM size impacts sampling efficiency across various model sizes and tasks.
- Pre-training performance scales with training compute, showing a link between compute resources and LDM performance.
- Downstream performance scales with pre-training, with larger models outperforming smaller ones even with extra training.
- Smaller models initially surpass larger models in image quality for a given sampling budget.
- The choice of sampler does not change scaling efficiency, with smaller models consistently demonstrating superior sampling efficiency.
- Smaller models sample more efficiently on downstream tasks with fewer steps.
- Diffusion distillation does not significantly alter scaling trends, with smaller models maintaining competitive performance.
- Smaller models exhibit better image quality than larger models when computational constraints are in place.
- The size of pre-trained text-to-image LDMs impacts their sampling efficiency across diverse downstream tasks.
- Changes in classifier-free guidance (CFG) rates impact visual quality more than prompt semantic accuracy.
- Smaller models consistently demonstrate superior sampling efficiency regardless of the diffusion sampler used.
