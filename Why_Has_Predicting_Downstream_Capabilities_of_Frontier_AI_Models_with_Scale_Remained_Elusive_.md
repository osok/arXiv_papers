# SUMMARY
The text discusses the challenges in predicting AI systems' capabilities as they scale, focusing on metrics like accuracy and Brier score, and how these metrics' transformations impact predictability.

# IDEAS:
- Predicting specific abilities of AI systems as they scale up remains a significant challenge.
- Common metrics like accuracy and Brier score may not reflect performance changes with scale.
- Metrics compare model output with specific incorrect answers, complicating performance prediction.
- Probability of choosing incorrect answers changes as computational power increases.
- Scaling laws based on pre-training loss remain more consistent than individual task performance.
- Standardized evaluation tools ensure results are comparable to previous studies.
- Model families like Pythia, Cerebras, GPT, MMO Insight, and LLM 360 were analyzed.
- Performance on NLP benchmarks tests comprehension, reasoning, and general knowledge.
- Transformations from log likelihoods to probabilities impact correlation with accuracy.
- Decrease in correlation values indicates a change in predictability across benchmarks.
- Distribution of probability masses on incorrect choices affects performance unpredictability.
- Metrics like accuracy and Brier score rely on probability mass distribution among choices.
- Brier score provides more continuous scores but can't fully capture model's probability distribution.
- Fitting scaling trends for each incorrect choice could help predict changes in metrics.
- Future research should focus on fitting and extrapolating scaling trends for better predictability.
- Understanding probability mass fluctuations is crucial for accurate performance predictions.
- Predicting benchmark performance requires access to scores from various model families.
- A good predictive model should foresee changes in standard metrics ahead of time.
- Evaluations should consider both correct and incorrect choice probability masses for reliability.
- Visualizing distribution shifts helps understand the relationship between scores and compute.
