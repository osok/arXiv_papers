# IDEAS:
- The main problem is enabling LLMs to perform complex multi-step tasks in dynamic environments.
- The paper focuses on improving LLM agents' performance on web tasks using self-improvement techniques.
- Self-improvement techniques involve fine-tuning on synthetic training data without additional supervised data.
- Synthetic data helps overcome the scarcity and cost of acquiring supervised training data.
- The paper introduces more realistic and diverse tasks for LLMs to navigate and complete.
- Existing benchmarks have limitations that the proposed method aims to address.
- The method leverages self-improvement strategies like fine-tuning on synthetic data and self-critique.
- Synthetic training examples are generated by the base LLM model itself.
- In-domain synthetic examples are filtered to remove low-quality trajectories.
- Out-of-domain synthetic examples involve creating novel tasks, objectives, web pages, and solution trajectories.
- Fine-tuning involves training the LLM model on different synthetic data mixtures.
- Mixture A uses in-domain synthetic examples only.
- Mixture B uses both in-domain and out-of-domain synthetic examples.
- Mixture C uses out-of-domain synthetic examples only.
- Fine-tuning uses an auto-regressive loss function with specific hyperparameters.
- The technique aims to amplify knowledge, correct behaviors, and introduce regularization.
- Experiments show performance improvements with all three synthetic data mixtures.
- The best-performing mixture yields a 31% improvement over the base LLM agent.
- Synthetic data allows models to acquire new capabilities through self-improvement.
- Synthetic data generation enables learning from diverse and novel tasks, improving generalization.
- Using synthetic data is cost-effective and efficient for training models on complex tasks.
- The paper validates techniques through experiments assessing performance on the Web Arena Benchmark.
- Iterative self-improvement experiments assess further improvement potential from subsequent rounds.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data mixtures results in significant performance improvements.
- Mixture B demonstrated a 31% relative improvement by completing 18 more tasks correctly.
- Training on all mixtures showed self-improvement on at least one metric.
- Mixture C showed a gain in the capability score but degraded trajectory quality.
- Limitations include diminishing returns to successive rounds of self-improvement.
