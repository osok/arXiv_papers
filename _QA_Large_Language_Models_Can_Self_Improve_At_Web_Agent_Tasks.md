# SUMMARY
The paper addresses improving large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-step tasks using self-improvement techniques with synthetic training data, enhancing performance without additional supervised data.

# IDEAS:
- The main problem is enabling LLMs to perform complex multi-step tasks in dynamic environments.
- The paper introduces self-improvement techniques through fine-tuning on synthetic training data.
- These techniques aim to enhance LLM agents without needing additional supervised training data.
- Existing benchmarks have limitations, necessitating more realistic and diverse tasks.
- The proposed method leverages self-improvement strategies involving fine-tuning on synthetic data.
- Unsupervised techniques like self-critique are used to filter and improve training examples.
- Synthetic training examples are generated by the base LLM model itself.
- In-domain synthetic examples are filtered to remove low-quality trajectories.
- Out-of-domain synthetic examples involve creating novel tasks, objectives, and solution trajectories.
- Fine-tuning involves training the LLM model on three different synthetic data mixtures.
- Mixture A uses in-domain synthetic examples only.
- Mixture B uses both in-domain and out-of-domain synthetic examples.
- Mixture C uses out-of-domain synthetic examples only.
- The fine-tuning process uses an auto-regressive loss function.
- Experiments show all three synthetic data mixtures lead to performance improvements.
- The best-performing mixture yields a 31% improvement over the base LLM agent.
- Synthetic data allows models to acquire new capabilities through self-improvement.
- Synthetic data generation enables learning from diverse and novel tasks.
- Using synthetic data is cost-effective and efficient for tasks lacking real-world training data.
- The new techniques are validated through experiments involving fine-tuning on synthetic data mixtures.
- Experiments assess performance using standard metrics and new auxiliary metrics.
- Iterative self-improvement experiments assess further improvement from subsequent rounds.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data mixtures results in significant performance improvements.
- Mixture B demonstrated a 31% relative improvement by completing 18 more tasks correctly.
- Training on all mixtures showed self-improvement on at least one metric.
- Mixture C showed a gain in the capability score but degraded trajectory quality.
- Fine-tuning on mixtures A and B improved the capability score equally.
- Iterative self-improvement shows diminishing returns with successive rounds.
- Quality of synthetic data decreases with each iteration, potentially reinforcing incorrect actions.
