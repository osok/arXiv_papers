- Long context in-context learning offers a strong alternative to traditional methods.
- The method was validated through systematic study and comparison with fine-tuning.
- Performance was measured using accuracy and macro F1 metrics.
- Constrained decoding ensured valid labels as output.
- Performance continues to increase past 2,000 demonstrations.
- Accuracy gains averaged 36.8 points across five datasets.
