# SUMMARY
The paper investigates whether Transformer models intentionally prepare information for future tokens or unintentionally leave traces that benefit future predictions.

# IDEAS:
- The main research question is whether Transformer models intentionally prepare information for future tokens.
- The study introduces myopic Transformer models to disentangle pre-caching from breadcrumbs.
- Humans predict upcoming language input while speaking, unlike contemporary language models.
- Language models allocate a fixed amount of information processing for each token.
- Recent work shows language models can predict tokens beyond the immediate next token.
- The paper explores pre-caching and breadcrumbs hypotheses in Transformer models.
- Pre-caching involves computing features useful for future time steps, even if irrelevant now.
- Breadcrumbs hypothesis suggests features beneficial for the present task also help future predictions.
- Myopic training scheme optimizes only for the current position's loss without considering future losses.
- Off diagonal gradient terms are training signals that encourage pre-caching in Transformer models.
- The myopic training scheme measures how much pre-caching is taking place in the model.
- Pre-caching may sacrifice immediate performance for future predictions.
- The myopia Gap measures the difference between myopic and optimal model performance.
- Untied myopia Gap assesses the impact of past features on future performance with untied parameters.
- Tied myopia Gap evaluates model performance without deliberate pre-caching with tied parameters.
- Bernoulli variables control timing and relevance of pre-cached information in synthetic experiments.
- Myopia Gap in natural language experiments indicates a small benefit from pre-caching.
- Myopic model initially outperforms vanilla model but falls behind as past length increases.
- Myopic model still utilizes past information significantly despite optimizing only for present tasks.
- Vanilla model efficiently balances present inference and future prediction without significant pre-caching.
