# SUMMARY
The paper investigates whether Transformer models intentionally prepare information for future tokens or unintentionally leave traces. It introduces myopic Transformer models to explore this.

# IDEAS:
- Transformer models may pre-cache information for future tokens or leave breadcrumbs unintentionally.
- Myopic Transformer models do not propagate gradients from current to previous positions.
- Humans predict upcoming language input while speaking, unlike contemporary language models.
- Language models allocate fixed information processing for each token.
- Model activations at a given time step can predict future outputs.
- Pre-caching hypothesis: models compute features useful for future steps.
- Breadcrumbs hypothesis: features beneficial for present tasks also help future predictions.
- Myopic training optimizes only for the current position's loss.
- Off diagonal gradient terms encourage pre-caching in traditional training.
- Pre-caching involves storing features useful for future predictions, even if irrelevant now.
- Breadcrumbs hypothesis suggests present task features inadvertently benefit future predictions.
- Off diagonal gradient terms measure how much pre-caching occurs in a model.
- Untied myopia Gap measures loss gap with untied parameters across positions.
- Tied myopia Gap measures loss gap with tied parameters optimal for the present task.
- Bernoulli variables control timing and relevance of pre-cached information in experiments.
- Myopia Gap in natural language experiments indicates small benefit from pre-caching.
- Myopic model outperforms vanilla model initially but falls behind as past length increases.
- Vanilla model efficiently uses past information without significant pre-caching.
- Myopic model still utilizes past information significantly despite optimizing for present tasks.
- Myopic model performs better than Transformer Byram model without deliberate pre-caching.

# INSIGHTS:

- Off diagonal gradient terms are crucial for understanding pre-caching in models.
- Pre-caching can sacrifice immediate performance for future benefits.
- Breadcrumbs hypothesis suggests incidental benefits from present task features.
- Myopia Gaps quantify the impact of past features on future performance.
- Bernoulli variables help study pre-caching under different conditions in experiments.
- Small myopia Gap in natural language experiments suggests limited benefit from pre-caching.
