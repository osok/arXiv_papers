# SUMMARY
The text explores the challenges large language models (LLMs) face in implicit reasoning, focusing on Transformers. It investigates whether scaling data and compute can improve reasoning or if inherent limitations exist. Experiments show that Transformers can learn implicit reasoning through extensive training, emphasizing the importance of data distribution and memory sharing mechanisms.
