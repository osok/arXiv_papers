# SUMMARY
The text discusses machine unlearning, focusing on deep neural networks and introducing the efficient in-context learning algorithm called ERAS. It also proposes a holistic metric for evaluating unlearning costs.

# IDEAS:
- Machine unlearning modifies a model to behave as if certain data was never used.

- Retraining models without specific data is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- Efficient unlearning methods exist for some algorithms but not for deep neural networks.
- Large language models (LLMs) offer new ideas for quick, accurate unlearning.
- LLMs learn in two steps: general learning and task-specific learning.
- In-context learning uses prompts to teach models specific tasks.
- In-context learning can unlearn data without changing the model itself.
