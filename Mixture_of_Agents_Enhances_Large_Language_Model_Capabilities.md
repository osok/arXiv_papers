# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation.
- LLMs trained on vast data and aligned with human preferences show remarkable capabilities.
- Scaling up LLMs is costly, and each model has its own strengths and specialties.
- Combining the expertise of multiple LLMs can create a more powerful model.
- Collaborativeness of LLMs shows models perform better when referring to outputs from other models.
- Performance improves even when auxiliary responses are of lower quality than a single LLM's output.
- Mixture of Agents (MOA) leverages multiple LLMs to enhance response quality iteratively.
- MOA involves layers of agents generating and refining responses for robust outputs.
- Effective collaboration requires selecting LLMs based on performance metrics and output diversity.
- MOA aims to overcome individual model limitations through collaborative synthesis.
- MOA achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0.
- Proposers provide diverse perspectives, while aggregators synthesize responses into high-quality outputs.
- Models like GPT-4 and Quen 1.5 excel in both proposer and aggregator roles.
- Wizard LM is more effective as a proposer than an aggregator.
- Multiple aggregators iteratively refine responses, leveraging various models' strengths.
- MOA structure includes multiple layers with several LLMs reused within and across layers.
- Each LLM processes input text and generates continuation without fine-tuning.
- Final output is the result of the LLM in the last layer, simplifying the process.
- MOA extends the mixture of experts (MoE) technique to operate at the model level.
- Gating and expert networks' roles are consolidated into LLMs for coherent outputs.
- MOA eliminates the need for fine-tuning, offering flexibility across various LLMs.
- MOA outperforms GPT-4 on benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using open-source models.
- MOA light variant prioritizes cost-effectiveness with fewer layers and specific aggregators.
- MOA light shows a 1.8% improvement in quality on Alpaca Eval 2.0 over GPT-4.
- Evaluations on benchmarks like MT Bench and Flask demonstrate MOA's robustness and efficiency.
- MOA excels in robustness, correctness, efficiency, factuality, common sense, and insightfulness.
- Aggregator likely performs sophisticated aggregation over proposed outputs rather than simple selection.
- Positive correlations between similarity scores and preference scores indicate effective aggregation.
- Increasing the number of proposers improves output quality by providing more auxiliary information.
- Diverse set of LLM agents in each MOA layer enhances performance compared to a single LLM.
- Models like GPT-4, Quen, and Llama 3 are versatile in assisting and aggregating tasks.
- Wizard LM excels as a proposer but struggles in aggregating responses from other models.
- Budget and token analysis shows models balancing cost and performance effectively.
- MOA light matches GPT-4's cost with higher quality and cost-effectiveness.
- T-flops consumption analysis shows models maximizing performance with computational resources.
