- Combining multiple LLMs can create a more powerful model.
- Collaborativeness of LLMs shows models perform better when referring to outputs from other models.
- Performance improves even when auxiliary responses are of lower quality.
- Mixture of Agents (MOA) leverages multiple LLMs to enhance response quality iteratively.
- MOA involves layers of agents generating and refining responses for robust outputs.
- Effective collaboration requires careful selection of LLMs based on performance metrics and diversity.
- MOA aims to overcome individual model limitations through collaborative synthesis.

- Proposers provide diverse perspectives, while aggregators synthesize high-quality outputs.
- Models like GPT-4 and Quen 1.5 excel in both proposer and aggregator roles.
- Wizard LM is more effective as a proposer.
- Multiple aggregators iteratively refine responses, leveraging various models' strengths.
- MOA structure includes multiple layers with several LLMs reused within and across layers.
- Each LLM processes input text and generates continuation without fine-tuning.
- Final output is the result of the LLM in the last layer.
- MOA extends the mixture of experts (MoE) technique to operate at the model level.
- MOA uses LLMs entirely through the prompt interface without modifying internal activations or weights.
- MOA eliminates the need for fine-tuning, offering flexibility and scalability.
