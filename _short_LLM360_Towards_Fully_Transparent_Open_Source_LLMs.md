# SUMMARY
The paper proposes the LLM 360 framework to enhance transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in releasing large language models (LLMs).

# IDEAS:
- Public release of pre-training data is crucial to assess potential behavior issues and biases.
- Releasing details about data filtering, processing, and training order is essential.
- Open sourcing all LLM pre-training frameworks, including training source code, hyperparameters, and system configurations.
- A balanced hybrid data model pipeline with 3D parallelism can outperform standard FSDP and PyTorch by 15%.
- Keeping the inverse frequency matrix in RoPE positional embedding in FP32 is important.
- Releasing training code, hyperparameters, and configurations enables replication and optimization.
- Making model checkpoints, including weights and optimizer states, publicly available.
- Checkpoints facilitate continued training from various starting points without starting from scratch.
- Checkpoints enable the study of different data and hyperparameter schedules.
- Checkpoints help reproduce infrequently occurring training faults.
- Detailed logs, intermediate metrics, and evaluation results provide insights into the training process.
- Metrics facilitate a deeper understanding of how LLMs evolve during training scenarios.
- Sharing metrics enables researchers to conduct their own analysis and make significant findings.
- Metrics are released in coordination with data chunks and checkpoints for easy correspondence.
- Analysis and evaluation code used for reproducibility is also provided.
- Transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration are emphasized in the release of LLMs.
- Providing specific examples and details supports the proposals within the LLM 360 framework.
- The framework aims to equip the community with better tools to assess LLM capabilities and risks.
- The framework supports building upon existing LLMs for future use cases.
