- The model generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary to predict forthcoming tokens.
- The training process estimates the probability of a sequence of n random consecutive tokens.
- Forward (FW) and backward (BW) models are trained on identical data slices.
- FW and BW models predict the next and previous tokens, respectively.
