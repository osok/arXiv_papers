# SUMMARY
The paper explores the concept of the arrow of time (AOT) in natural language processing, using tokenization and autoregressive models to predict token sequences.

# IDEAS:
- The concept of an arrow of time (AOT) in natural language processing is explored comprehensively.
- A vocabulary of 50,257 tokens is meticulously selected for the study.
- Data is tokenized into sequences structured into sentences of N1 tokens with a stride of N2.
- Each token is presented within a context that facilitates meaningful interpretation and analysis.
- An autoregressive model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence.
- The model generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary to predict forthcoming tokens.
- The training process estimates the probability of a sequence of n random consecutive tokens.
- Forward (FW) and backward (BW) models are trained on identical data slices.
- FW and BW models aim to predict the next and previous tokens, respectively.
- Differences in learning dynamics between FW and BW models are meticulously analyzed.
- The influence of long-range correlations on AOT is examined.
- The relationship between context length and model size is analyzed.
- Models of varying sizes and different languages are trained to uncover AOT nuances.
- Empirical results reveal a consistent presence of AOT across more than 50 model modalities.
- Tokenization artifacts are ruled out as influencing findings.
- The computability and irreversibility of AOT are explored through mathematical models.
- Computational hardness of reversing certain information-preserving operations is investigated.
- A general class of data models is constructed to shed light on AOT from sparsity and complexity theory perspectives.
- The study opens avenues for further research and application in natural language processing.
