# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Motion GPT, a pre-trained model integrating human motion and language for various tasks. It aims to benefit sectors like gaming, robotics, and virtual assistants.

# IDEAS:
- A universal pre-trained model for human motion and language hasn't emerged yet.
- Motion GPT treats human motion as a foreign language, integrating motion and language data.
- The model uses a motion-specific vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE).
- Motion GPT performs well in text-to-motion, motion-to-text, motion prediction, and motion in-between tasks.
- The model leverages robust language generation and zero-shot transferabilities of pre-trained language models.
- Motion GPT uses a two-stage training scheme: pre-training on raw motion data and fine-tuning on instruction datasets.
- The model's motion tokenizer translates raw motion data into discrete motion tokens.
- The motion-aware language model learns to comprehend these motion tokens guided by textual descriptions.
- The training strategy includes three phases: training the motion tokenizer, motion language pre-training, and instruction tuning.
- The model uses a unified text-motion vocabulary for flexible representation and generation of diverse outputs.
- The Transformer-based model predicts the next token in an auto-regressive manner.
- The training process involves supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn the relationship between text and motion.
- Instruction tuning enhances the model's performance across various tasks and unseen prompts.
- Evaluation metrics include FID, Aid, fde, diversity, multimodality, R-Precision, m-dist, blue, Rouge, cider, and Bert score.
- The model was trained on eight Tesla V100 GPUs with specific learning rates and batch sizes.
- Comparisons show Motion GPT is competitive in text-to-motion, motion-to-text, motion prediction, and in-between tasks.
- Ablation studies reveal the base 220 million parameter model performs impressively.
- Instruction tuning improves flexibility but may decrease performance in pure text generation tasks.
- Motion GPT is limited to human body motion and doesn't consider facial expressions or hand gestures.
- The model doesn't account for interactions between multiple humans or humans and objects/environment.
- Motion GPT holds potential for modeling human interactions and generating controllable motions.
- Future improvements could include handling natural question answering tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
- Treating human motion as a foreign language can unify motion and language data effectively.
- A unified text-motion vocabulary allows for flexible representation of diverse outputs.
- Instruction tuning significantly enhances the model's versatility across various tasks.
- Larger models don't always lead to better performance due to limited motion data availability.
- Motion GPT's approach can potentially revolutionize sectors like gaming, robotics, and virtual assistants.
