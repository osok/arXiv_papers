# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Motion GPT, a pre-trained model integrating human motion and language data to handle various motion-related tasks. It aims to benefit sectors like gaming, robotics, and virtual assistants.

# IDEAS:
- A universal pre-trained model for human motion and language hasn't emerged yet.
- Motion GPT treats human motion as a foreign language, integrating motion and language data.
- The model uses a motion-specific vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE).
- Motion GPT performs well in text-to-motion, motion-to-text, motion prediction, and motion in-between tasks.
- The model leverages robust language generation and zero-shot transferabilities of pre-trained language models.
- Motion GPT uses a two-stage training scheme: pre-training on raw motion data and fine-tuning on instruction datasets.
- The model's motion tokenizer translates raw motion data into discrete motion tokens.
- The motion-aware language model learns to comprehend these motion tokens guided by textual descriptions.
- The training process includes three phases: training the motion tokenizer, motion language pre-training, and instruction tuning.
- The unified text-motion vocabulary allows for flexible representation and generation of diverse motion-related outputs.
- The Transformer-based model predicts the probability distribution of the next token in an auto-regressive manner.
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like FID, ADE, FDE, diversity, multimodality, R-Precision, and M-Dist.
- Motion GPT is compared with state-of-the-art models on tasks like text-to-motion, motion-to-text, and motion prediction.
- The model shows competitive performance across all evaluated tasks.
- Instruction tuning enhances the model's performance on various tasks and improves unseen task performance.
- The model size and training strategy significantly influence Motion GPT's performance.
- Larger models do not always lead to better performance due to limited motion data availability.
- Motion GPT is designed to work only with human body motion, not facial expressions or hand gestures.
- The model does not account for interactions between multiple humans or between humans and objects.
- Motion GPT holds potential for modeling human interactions and generating controllable motions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Treating human motion as a foreign language can unify motion and language data effectively.
- A unified text-motion vocabulary enables flexible representation of diverse motion-related tasks.
- Instruction tuning significantly enhances the model's versatility and performance across tasks.
- Limited motion data availability can hinder the performance of larger models.
- Motion GPT's approach can potentially extend to modeling human interactions and generating controllable motions.
