# SUMMARY
Ruler is a new benchmark for evaluating long-context language models through synthetic tasks like retrieval, multihop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.

# IDEAS:
- Ruler assesses language models' capabilities in handling long context scenarios.
- It includes four task categories: retrieval, multihop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.
- Ruler uses synthetic tasks to control sequence length and task complexity.
- Synthetic input reduces reliance on prior knowledge, aiding long context performance.
- Ten long-context language models were evaluated using Ruler.
- Models showed significant performance drops with increased task complexity and sequence length.
- Only four models effectively handled sequences of 32k tokens or more.
- GP4, Command R, E34B, and Mixol consistently outperformed others.
- Larger model sizes generally correlated with better long-context handling.
- Fine-tuning on longer sequences did not always improve performance.
- Retrieval tasks involve finding specific information in large text amounts.
- Multi-hop tracing tracks variables and identifies references throughout the text.
- Aggregation tasks summarize relevant information by identifying common or frequent words.
- Question answering tasks simulate real-world scenarios with long passages.
- Models were tested on 13 tasks with different complexities from Ruler categories.
- Performance decreased as input length increased in Ruler tasks.
- None maintained performance above Llama 2 to 7B baseline at claimed context length.
- GP4 showed the least degradation when extending context size.
- E34B2000K model struggled with word-number pairs and distractors.
- Models had a strong tendency to copy from the context when input length scaled up.
- Errors included returning empty strings or incorrect variables in variable tracking tasks.
- Aggregation tasks failed due to incorrect contextual information use and inaccurate aggregation.
- Larger context sizes generally led to better performance but inconsistently for longer sequences.
- Larger models outperformed smaller ones, highlighting benefits of scaling model sizes.
- Non-transformer architectures experienced significant performance decline with increased context size.

# INSIGHTS:
- Synthetic tasks allow better control over sequence length and task complexity.
- Larger model sizes correlate positively with better long-context capabilities.
- Fine-tuning on longer sequences doesn't always improve model performance.
- Models tend to copy verbatim from the context when input length scales up.
- Aggregation tasks often fail due to incorrect contextual information use.
- Larger context sizes generally lead to better performance but inconsistently for longer sequences.
- Non-transformer architectures perform worse than transformer-based models at longer contexts.
- GP4 showed the least degradation when extending context size among tested models.
- Errors in variable tracking include returning empty strings or incorrect variables.
- Question answering tasks show frequent hallucinations with increased context size.
