- ChatDB uses databases for structured storage of historical data with SQL statements.
- The chain of memory approach simplifies user input into intermediate memory operation steps.
- ChatDB significantly outperforms ChatGPT on synthetic datasets.
- Memory-augmented LLMs introduce a memory component to manage extended text inputs.
- Retrieval-augmented in-context learning employs retrieval models to gather relevant information.
- Neural Turing Machines combine recurrent neural networks with external trainable memory resources.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) presents the reasoning process to the language model, boosting reasoning capabilities.
- ChatDB views the database as an external memory module for LLMs.
- Toolformer educates language models to use external tools via APIs to solve problems.
- ChatDB's symbolic memory allows for accurate record-keeping and data analysis.
- The chain of memory approach enhances LLMs' ability to reason over symbolic memory.
- ChatDB's memory is structured, interpretable, and tracks the current state of LLMs.
- ChatDB uses MySQL as external symbolic memory and GPT-3.5 Turbo as the LLM controller.
- The fruit shop dataset simulates everyday operations in a fruit shop for testing ChatDB.
