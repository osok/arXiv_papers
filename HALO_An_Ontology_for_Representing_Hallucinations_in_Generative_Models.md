# SUMMARY
The paper discusses advancements in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, focusing on hallucinations where models create false information. It proposes the Hallucination Ontology (Halo) to standardize and study these hallucinations.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems have shown remarkable success in various fields.
- Concerns exist about the responsible use and deployment of these models.
- Hallucinations in LLMs can create or fabricate information, raising concerns about misinformation.
- Studies show that hallucinations are not rare and are reported by everyday users.
- There is no standard vocabulary or ontology for representing hallucinations.
- A common vocabulary would make data collection on hallucinations more consistent.
- Halo is proposed as a resource for modeling hallucination instances and their metadata.
- Halo aims to be a sustainable and extensible resource for researchers.
- Halo supports multiple hallucination categories and subcategories, metadata fields, and attributes.
- Preliminary evaluations show that not all LLMs hallucinate equally.
- Halo was designed following a rigorous process and supports empirical studies on hallucinations.
- The ontology consists of two main modules: the hallucination module and the metadata module.
- The hallucination module includes classes for different types of hallucinations.
- The metadata module represents core concepts and properties of prompts and answers.
- Halo is published under an open license and is available in machine-readable and human-readable formats.
- The ontology was validated using competency questions and SPARQL queries.
- Halo integrates with existing vocabularies to ensure interoperability.
- The evaluation showed that Bard had the highest hallucination rate among tested models.
- Halo can model a variety of hallucination types and support analytical queries.
- Future work will involve collecting more instances of hallucinations to expand the dataset.
