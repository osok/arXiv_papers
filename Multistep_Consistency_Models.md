# SUMMARY
The section discusses diffusion models for generating images, videos, and audio, highlighting their slow sampling speed. It introduces consistency models and proposes multi-step consistency models to improve performance with fewer steps.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models are powerful for generating images, videos, and audio but are slow in sampling.
- Consistency models improve sampling speed but often at the cost of image quality.
- Consistency models come in two types: consistency training (CT) and consistency distillation (CD).
- Multi-step consistency models divide the diffusion process into segments, each trained by a separate consistency model.
- Multi-step consistency models achieve performance comparable to standard diffusion models with fewer steps.
- Adjusted DDIM (AddIM) is a deterministic sampler that performs well on complex datasets.
- Multi-step consistency models achieve FID scores of 1.6 on ImageNet 64 and 2.3 on ImageNet 128 with four sampling steps.
- Diffusion models add noise to data, transforming it from a normal distribution to the original data.
- Sampling from diffusion models involves denoising equations and predicting data using a learned function.
- Consistency models aim to directly map noise to data by predicting the same data throughout the trajectory.
- Consistency training uses data to define noise, while consistency distillation uses a pre-trained diffusion model as a teacher.
- The DDM sampler is a linearization of the probability flow ODE used in diffusion models.
- Multi-step consistency loss targets noise instead of data for better interpretability and relation to standard diffusion losses.
- Many-step CT converges to diffusion models by aligning objectives at the beginning of each step.
- Training multi-step consistency models from pre-trained diffusion checkpoints leads to quicker and more stable convergence.
- AddIM addresses integration error causing blurry samples by adjusting the DDM sampler.
- Deterministic samplers degrade more gracefully than stochastic samplers when limiting sampling steps.
- Progressive distillation stages reduce the number of model evaluations during training.
- Specialized architectures distill knowledge from diffusion models into single-step models.
- Rectified flows and flow matching aim to reduce sampling times but require many evaluation steps.
- Increasing the number of steps in multi-step distillation leads to improved performance.
- Multi-step consistency may be less sensitive to hyperparameter choices, improving sample quality and performance.

# INSIGHTS:
- Combining consistency models and Tra improves performance with fewer sampling steps.
- Multi-step consistency models achieve competitive performance with just eight steps on ImageNet datasets.
- Adjusted DDIM (AddIM) performs well on complex datasets with as few as four sampling steps.
- Consistency training integrates probability flow through time, while diffusion models follow evolving expectations.
- Training multi-step consistency models from pre-trained diffusion checkpoints leads to faster convergence.
- Deterministic samplers degrade more gracefully than stochastic samplers when limiting sampling steps.
- Increasing the number of steps in multi-step distillation improves performance significantly.
- Multi-step consistency may be less sensitive to hyperparameter choices, enhancing sample quality and performance.
