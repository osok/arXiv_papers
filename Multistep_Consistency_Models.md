# SUMMARY
The text discusses diffusion models for generating images, videos, and audio, highlighting their slow sampling speed. It introduces multi-step consistency models to improve performance with fewer steps.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models are powerful for generating images, videos, and audio but are slow in sampling.
- Consistency models aim to map noise to data directly, predicting X based on zore 0.
- Consistency training (CT) and consistency distillation (CD) are two types of consistency models.
- Multi-step consistency models divide the diffusion process into segments, each trained by a separate model.
- Multi-step consistency models achieve competitive performance with as few as four or eight sampling steps.
- Adjusted DDIM (addIM) is a deterministic sampler introduced for diffusion models.
- AddIM performs well on complex datasets like ImageNet 128 with few sampling steps.
- The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is crucial for diffusion models.
- Sampling from diffusion models involves denoising equations and predicting X using a learned function.
- Diffusion models require hundreds of iterations for generative processes like image generation.
- Consistency models predict the same X throughout the trajectory by minimizing certain constraints.
- CD uses a pre-trained diffusion model as a teacher to guide the learning process.
- The DDM sampler is a linearization of the probability flow ODE used in diffusion models.
- Multi-step CT converges to standard diffusion training as the number of steps increases.
- Fine-tuning multi-step consistency models from a pre-trained diffusion checkpoint leads to quicker convergence.
- AddIM addresses integration error causing blurry samples by adjusting the DDM sampler.
- Deterministic samplers degrade more gracefully than stochastic samplers when limiting sampling steps.
- Progressive distillation stages reduce the number of model evaluations during training.
- Rectified flows and flow matching aim to reduce sampling times but require many evaluation steps.
- Multi-step consistency models achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet 64 and ImageNet 128.
- Increasing the number of steps in multi-step distillation improves performance significantly.
- Multi-step consistency may be less sensitive to hyperparameter choices, improving sample quality and performance.

# INSIGHTS:
