# SUMMARY
The paper discusses enhancing predictive accuracy in binary question forecasting through meticulous data curation, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.

# IDEAS:
- Data curation focused on binary questions to enhance predictive accuracy of models.
- Filtering out ill-defined questions and those with low forecasts or trading volume.
- Converting multiple choice questions into binary ones for better model training.
- Curated set of 5,516 binary questions designated for training, validation, and testing.
- Only questions posed after June 1st, 2024, were included in the dataset.
- Brier score used as a performance metric ideal for binary questions.
- Brier score calculated as the square of the difference between forecast and outcome.
- Baseline unskilled forecast achieved a Brier score of 0.25.
- Emphasis on calibration measured with root mean square calibration error.
- Evaluated 14 instruction-tuned language models using zero-shot and scratch pad prompts.
- GPT-4 and GPT-2 series significantly outperformed the unskilled baseline.
- GPT-4 1106 preview model achieved the lowest Brier score among tested models.
- Human crowd performance still outperformed the best model.
- Retrieval system designed in four steps: search query generation, news retrieval, relevance filtering, and text summarization.
- Language model-generated search queries retrieved historical articles from news APIs.
- News Catcher and Google News selected for their relevance in news retrieval.
- Summarized pertinent articles fed into models to optimize context window for prediction accuracy.
