# SUMMARY
The text discusses leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the trustworthiness of a commercial application that converts natural language into workflows.

# IDEAS:
- RAG aims to reduce hallucination in generating workflows from natural language.
- Workflows are represented as JSON documents with each step as an adjacent object.
- Fine-tuning large language models can lead to hallucination, especially with out-of-distribution inputs.
- RAG retrieves JSON objects to enhance the validity and executability of generated workflows.
- The retriever aligns semantics between natural language queries and structured JSON objects.
- Structured output tasks like text-to-code or text-to-SQL conversion require interpretable and executable output.
- Guided generation using outlines can help generate steps within a given context.
- The retriever suggests steps and tables which are added to the user query to form the LLM prompt.
- The retriever is trained to map natural language to existing step and database table names.
- Fine-tuning significantly improves retrieval results and domain-specific representation.
- A Siamese Transformer encoder with mean pooling encodes user queries, steps, and tables into fixed-length vectors.
- The retriever is trained on pairs of user queries and corresponding steps or tables, including positive and negative pairs.
- The retriever retrieves the top K steps and tables based on cosine similarity.
- The LLM is trained separately from the retriever for simplicity.
- The LLM training examples assume the retriever has 100% recall except for the most frequent steps.
- The system uses trigger exact match, bag of steps, hallucinated tables, and hallucinated steps metrics for evaluation.
- Fine-tuning the encoder was crucial for enhancing performance in code retrieval tasks.
- Scaling up model size helps improve certain metrics, especially with RAG.
- Larger models tend to perform better and hallucinate less compared to smaller models.
- Pre-training on a large amount of natural language data may not be beneficial for this task.
- Removing suggestions during evaluation significantly drops model performance.
- Errors in generated workflows can stem from issues in both the retriever and the language model.
- Breaking down queries into shorter texts can improve retriever performance.
- Synthetic data generation can help address logic-based step errors in the language model.
- Using a 7B parameter model allows for larger batch sizes and increased system throughput.
- Decoupling the retriever and language model enables easier reuse and independent optimization.
