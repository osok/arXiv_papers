# SUMMARY
The paper discusses enhancing reward-free MDPs using user preferences, introducing the regret preference model, and proposing the Corporal objective for optimal policy learning.

# IDEAS:
- Examining the reward-free MDP problem with a dataset of user preferences sets the research foundation.
- Augmenting the reward function with a negated log probability term maximizes the policy's causal entropy.
- This modification enhances offline RL and RHF approaches for large language models (LLMs).
- The regret preference model considers preferences distributed according to negated discounted regret under the optimal policy.
- This model resolves inconsistencies in previous preference models, accurately representing human preferences.
- Replacing the advantage function with the log probability of the policy simplifies the algorithm.
- This substitution eliminates the need to learn the advantage function or deal with RL optimization challenges.
- The Corporal objective is a contrastive loss function maximizing log likelihood of preferred behavior segments.
- Directly learning the optimal policy from regret-based preferences is enabled by the Corporal objective.
- Learning the policy in Corporal eliminates the need for learning reward or value functions.
- This simplification reduces computational cost and algorithm complexity.
- Practical considerations include learning from finite offline data sets.
- A conservative regularizer assigns lower loss when policy likelihood on actions in the dataset is higher.
- Keeping the policy in distribution is achieved through this conservative regularizer.
- Pre-training the policy with behavior cloning improves Corporal's results.
- These modifications enhance Corporal's performance and applicability in practice.
