# SUMMARY
The proposed Selective Language Modeling (SLM) approach aims to enhance language model efficiency by focusing on tokens with high excess loss, improving training data quality and downstream performance.

# IDEAS:
- SLM enhances language model efficiency by focusing on tokens with high excess loss.
- SLM filters out noisy and irrelevant tokens, prioritizing those aligned with desired distributions.
- SLM optimizes the learning process and stabilizes the model's training trajectory.
- SLM improves perplexity scores and performance on downstream benchmarks.
- SLM differs from CLM by selectively training on tokens with high excess loss.
- CLM applies cross-entropy loss uniformly to all tokens in the sequence.
- SLM uses a token selection ratio to determine beneficial tokens for training.
- A reference model scores tokens, guiding selective training in SLM.
- SLM excludes irrelevant or low-quality tokens, enhancing model efficiency.
- The reference model establishes a baseline for token evaluation in SLM.
- Tokens with high excess loss are considered more learnable and aligned with desired distributions.
- SLM focuses on tokens most beneficial for downstream applications.
- The token selection ratio determines the proportion of tokens included based on excess loss.
- SLM applies cross-entropy loss only to selected beneficial tokens.
- SLM improves token efficiency by focusing on high excess loss tokens.
- SLM outperforms CLM baselines by over 16% on GSM 8K and math datasets.
- Row 1 models match state-of-the-art performance using significantly fewer tokens.
- Row 1 models achieve baseline accuracy up to 10 times faster.
- SLM enhances token efficiency and improves downstream task performance.
- Selected tokens by SLM align better with downstream performance.
- The token selection ratio optimizes pre-training efficiency and effectiveness.
- SLM visualizes token selection and evaluates perplexity at different checkpoints.
- Tokens selected by later checkpoints have higher perplexity initially, then lower later.
- A double descent pattern is observed in the loss of selected tokens.
- Selecting tokens based on excess loss improves downstream task performance.

# INSIGHTS:
