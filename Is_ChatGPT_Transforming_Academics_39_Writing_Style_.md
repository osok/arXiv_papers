# SUMMARY
The text explores ChatGPT's impact on academic writing, particularly in abstracts, by analyzing word frequency changes in 1 million archive articles before and after its release.

# IDEAS:
- ChatGPT has 100 million active users within 3 months of its launch.
- ChatGPT can generate abstracts directly, making it hard to distinguish from human-written ones.
- Non-native English speakers in academia are significantly influenced by ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT offers broader applications and greater flexibility than tools like Google Translate.
- Analyzing word frequency changes can reveal ChatGPT's influence on academic writing.
- Words related to recent hot topics saw a significant increase in frequency post-ChatGPT release.
- Common words like "is" and "are" experienced a surge in frequency after ChatGPT's introduction.
- The presence of ChatGPT style in an abstract doesn't mean it was directly used.
- ChatGPT is reshaping academic writing, especially for non-native English-speaking researchers.
- Simulating ChatGPT processing on abstracts helps estimate word frequency changes.
- Different prompts lead to different outputs and word frequency changes in scientific writing.
- Noise and variability in word usage are not directly linked to ChatGPT's internal parameters.
- Selecting the right words can enhance estimates by reducing bias in the model.
- Real data noise is complex, requiring calibrations and tests using mixed ChatGPT processed abstracts.
- Word combinations that worked well in calibration also performed well in testing.
- ChatGPT's influence on abstracts is growing, particularly in computer science.
- Around 35% of recent texts in computer science exhibit characteristics similar to ChatGPT style.
- Astronomy and condensed matter physics showed impact values ranging between 10% and 20%.
- Using more specific prompts could potentially result in higher impact values.
- The measure of ChatGPT impact is relative and reflects changes in word frequency.

# INSIGHTS:
- ChatGPT's influence is significant for non-native English speakers in academia.
