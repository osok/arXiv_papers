# SUMMARY
The proposed method, Ditto, aims to align large language models (LLMs) to specific settings using a small number of user-provided examples, outperforming existing methods.

# IDEAS:
- Ditto aligns LLMs to specific settings using a small number of user-provided examples of desired behavior.
- It addresses the mismatch between universal LLM styles and specific application needs.
- User-provided demonstrations scaffold a dataset of preference comparisons for alignment.
- Ditto allows fast adaptation in data-limited settings, outperforming supervised fine-tuning and self-play methods.
- It generates comparison datasets for alignment using expert demonstrations and model outputs.
- Online imitation learning allows the model to extrapolate beyond expert performance.
- Ditto uses around five user-provided examples to scaffold preference comparisons.
- User demonstrations are treated as preferred over model outputs from original and earlier iterations.
- The augmented dataset updates the language model using an alignment algorithm like DPO.
- Ditto constructs an unbounded preference dataset with only a few demonstrations.
- Temporal aspects of learning generate comparisons using all policies learned over time.
- Ditto's methodology is more efficient and effective than traditional methods relying on large paired comparisons.
- It outperforms supervised fine-tuning, self-play methods, and few-shot prompting in aligning LLMs.
- Ditto does not require external signals besides demonstrations for effective alignment.
- Experiments focus on tasks with subjective preferences like email writing and essays.
- Ditto achieved an average win rate of 77.9% across different datasets in automatic evaluations.
- User studies showed Ditto outperformed baselines with a win rate of 72.1%.
- Users struggled to verbalize preferences into prompts, highlighting the effectiveness of demonstrated feedback.
- Careful selection of demonstrations is crucial as their quality affects Ditto's performance.
- Increasing negative samples improves performance but also increases runtime.
- Performance can vary among users, indicating challenges in generalizing effectiveness.
- There is a risk of overfitting if the reference model is continuously updated during online training.
- Early iterations may yield noisier samples, temporarily reducing performance.
- There may be diminishing returns in performance as more demonstrations are provided.

# INSIGHTS:
- Ditto efficiently aligns LLMs to specific settings using minimal user-provided examples.
- It leverages user demonstrations to create preference comparison datasets for alignment.
- Online imitation learning allows Ditto to exceed expert performance in alignment tasks.
- Temporal learning aspects generate diverse comparison datasets over time.
- Ditto's sample efficiency sets it apart from traditional alignment methods.
- User studies confirm Ditto's superior performance in aligning LLMs to preferences.
- Demonstrated feedback is more effective than verbalized preferences for alignment tasks.
- Quality and careful selection of demonstrations are critical for Ditto's success.
- Increasing negative samples improves performance but at the cost of increased runtime.
- Overfitting risks exist if the reference model is continuously updated during training.
