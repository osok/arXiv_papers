# SUMMARY
The proposed method, Ditto, aims to align large language models (LLMs) to specific settings using a small number of user-provided examples, outperforming existing methods.

# IDEAS:
- Ditto aligns LLMs to specific settings using a small number of user-provided examples.
- It addresses the mismatch between universal LLM style and specific application needs.
- User-provided demonstrations scaffold a dataset of preference comparisons.
- Ditto allows fast adaptation in data-limited settings.
- It outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), self-play methods like Spin, and few-shot prompting.
- Expert demonstrations and model outputs generate comparison datasets for alignment.
- Online imitation learning helps the model extrapolate beyond expert performance.
- Ditto uses around five user-provided examples of desired behavior.
- Examples come from user interaction logs or direct edits to LLM outputs.
- User demonstrations are treated as preferred over model outputs.
- The augmented dataset updates the language model using an alignment algorithm like DPO.
- Ditto constructs an unbounded preference dataset with few demonstrations.
- Temporal learning generates comparisons using all policies learned over time.
- Ditto's methodology is more efficient and effective than traditional methods.
- It does not require external signals besides demonstrations.
- Ditto's sample efficiency sets it apart from traditional methods.
- Experiments focus on tasks with subjective preferences like email writing and essays.
- Ditto outperforms baselines with an average win rate of 77.9%.
- A user study shows Ditto's win rate at 72.1% in aligning to demonstrated preferences.
- Users struggle with verbalizing preferences into prompts, highlighting Ditto's effectiveness.
- Careful selection of demonstrations is crucial for Ditto's performance.
- Increasing negative samples improves performance but increases runtime.
- Performance varies among users, indicating challenges in generalizing effectiveness.
- Risk of overfitting if the reference model is continuously updated.
- Early iterations may yield noisier samples, reducing performance temporarily.
- There may be diminishing returns in performance with more demonstrations.
