# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), a technique to improve sequence parallelism in linear Transformers by dividing sequences into smaller chunks distributed across GPUs. LASP optimizes communication and execution efficiency, extending sequence lengths up to eight times under the same hardware constraints.
