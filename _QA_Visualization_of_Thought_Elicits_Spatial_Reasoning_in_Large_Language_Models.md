# SUMMARY
The proposed Visualization of Thought (VoT) prompting method aims to enhance spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by eliciting mental imagery, improving their performance on spatial tasks.

# IDEAS:
- VoT prompts LLMs to create and manipulate mental images for spatial reasoning.
- Visual State tracking represents a partial solution at each reasoning step.
- VoT introduces a visual spatial sketch pad to each thought generated by the LLM.
- VoT enables LLMs to generate reasoning traces and visualizations in an interleaved manner.
- VoT helps LLMs ground their reasoning in visual representations.
- VoT addresses the limitation of LLMs relying solely on language for spatial reasoning.
- VoT enhances LLMs' ability to generate accurate visualizations at each step.
- VoT significantly increases the visual tracking rate by explicitly prompting visualization.
- VoT improves LLMs' performance in tasks like navigation and tiling.
- VoT method was validated through empirical evaluations on natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling tasks.
- GPT-4 VoT outperformed other settings in all tasks across all metrics.
- Inconsistencies between language instructions and visualizations indicate a limitation in spatial understanding.
- LLMs may struggle with accurately visualizing internal states, leading to suboptimal visualizations.
- Self-refinement suggests initial visualizations may not always align with correct spatial understanding.
- VoT may underperform in tasks where logical reasoning can be leveraged without visualizing internal states.
- Performance drops significantly in more challenging tasks like root planning.
- Future work includes refining state visualizations and exploring the balance between visualizations and logical reasoning.
- Visual State tracking behaviors differ among prompting methods like GPT-4 VoT, GPT-4 CoT, and GPT-4 without visualization.
- Visualizations enhance final answers by providing spatial understanding and visualization capability.
- VoT method shows promise in improving spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
