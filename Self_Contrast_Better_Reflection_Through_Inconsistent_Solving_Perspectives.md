# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in self-correction and propose a contrastive strategy called self-cast to improve reflection and accuracy.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs often produce inaccurate results and struggle to self-correct.
- Post-hoc prompting involves generating an initial response, gathering feedback, and refining the response.
- Self-reflection within LLMs had limited impact, correcting only 15.1% of incorrect responses.
- Feedback from self-evaluation often leads to overconfidence or inconsistency.
- Self-cast involves generating multiple solving perspectives and comparing discrepancies to enhance reflection.
- Self-curated prompts guide LLMs to create diverse perspectives tailored to user requests.
- Graph construction builds a contrasted graph based on interrelations of different perspectives.
- Contrastive reflection revises each inconsistent node on the graph, eliminating differences.
- LLMs tend to trust the initial solution rather than detect and revise errors.
- Using a stronger LLM for evaluation improves reflection performance.
- Feedback is often overconfident or inconsistent, leading to ineffective reflection.
- Self-cast reduces biases introduced by specific prompts through diverse perspectives.
- Contrasting discrepancies between perspectives inspires deeper reflection.
- Self-cast shows significant improvements in mathematical reasoning and translation tasks.
- Smaller LLMs show weaker reflection ability, sometimes having negative impacts.
- Self-cast requires less manual effort and has a more reasonable call overhead compared to multi-agent debate.
- Self-cast reduces the occurrence of invalid and toxic reflections.
- Comparing two wrong answers with different mistakes significantly improves performance.
- Diverse solving perspectives mitigate biases introduced by singular prompts.
- Checklist generation process facilitates re-examination of discrepancies.
- Self-cast can be applied to various task types, showing versatility.
