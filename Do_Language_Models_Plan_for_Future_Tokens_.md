# SUMMARY
Researchers explore if language models, like humans, predict future tokens. Evidence suggests models lean towards "breadcrumbs" rather than "pre-caching."

# IDEAS:
- Language models can predict tokens beyond the immediate next one by analyzing hidden states.
- Manipulating hidden states can influence future outputs in language models.
- It is unclear if models prepare for future steps at the expense of current performance.
- Models adjust weights based on current and future tokens during training.
- Two hypotheses: pre-caching (storing future relevant information) and breadcrumbs (current features aid future predictions).
- Myopic training approach does not propagate gradients from current to previous positions.
- Evidence supports pre-caching in synthetic tasks but breadcrumbs in natural language tasks.
- Transformer models have separate parameters for each position from 1 to n.
- Off diagonal gradient terms represent the expected gradient of future loss with respect to current weights.
- Myopia Gap measures how close a myopic model's performance is to an optimal model's performance.
- Myopic gradient descent removes off diagonal terms, leading to stable optimization conditions.
- Forward bias condition is crucial for convergence in tied weight scenarios.
- Synthetic data experiments show significant pre-caching benefits for Transformer regression models.
- Myopic models struggle with pre-caching due to limitations in off diagonal gradient terms.
- Linear probing techniques analyze model behavior and pre-caching effectiveness.
- Natural language experiments assess pre-caching in Transformer models using the GPT-2 architecture.
- Myopia Gap and local myopia bonus measure pre-caching benefits in natural language tasks.
- Standard models show a small benefit from pre-caching with a myopia gap of 0.12.
- Myopic models initially perform better but degrade as sequence length increases.
- The gap between standard and myopic models indicates the importance of pre-caching for long sequences.
- Near zero local myopia gap suggests standard models do not heavily prioritize present features over future pre-caching.

# INSIGHTS:

- Myopia Gap measures the effectiveness of pre-caching in model performance.
- Forward bias is essential for convergence in tied weight scenarios during myopic descent.
- Synthetic data experiments highlight the benefits of pre-caching for specific tasks.
- Myopic models struggle without off diagonal gradient terms, impacting performance.
- Linear probing helps analyze the effectiveness of pre-caching strategies in models.
- Natural language experiments show limited pre-caching benefits in standard Transformer models.
