# SUMMARY
The text discusses evaluating language model outputs using direct assessment and pairwise ranking. It introduces Prometheus 2 models, which merge these methods for improved performance.

# IDEAS:
- Evaluating language model outputs is challenging due to the wide range of text and tasks.
- Language model-based evaluation methods include direct assessment and pairwise ranking.
- Private language models as evaluators show high agreement with human evaluations.
- Private models have drawbacks like lack of transparency, fairness issues, and high costs.
- Open Access evaluator models struggle to match human judgments or private models' decisions.
- Combining direct assessment and pairwise ranking creates a robust unified evaluator model.
- Prometheus 2 models excel in both direct assessment and pairwise ranking evaluations.
- The preference collection dataset includes diverse evaluation criteria beyond helpfulness and harmlessness.
- Merging weights from models trained on different feedback datasets improves performance.
- Traditional metrics like Rouge, BLEU, and BERTScore may miss good quality responses.
- Language models offer more depth and granularity similar to human evaluation.
- Open evaluator models currently lack flexibility and show weaker performance compared to private models.
- Weight merging has shown performance improvements in various domains.
- Prometheus 2 models aim to enhance open evaluator models to match private models.
- Direct assessment involves mapping an instruction response to a numerical score.
- Pairwise ranking compares two responses to an instruction to determine the preferred one.
- Verbal feedback improves the correlation between model scores and human scores.
- Fine-grained evaluation in pairwise ranking focuses on the evaluation criterion itself.
- The preference collection includes 1,000 evaluation criteria for fine-grained evaluation.
- Single format training trains a base model on either direct assessment or pairwise ranking feedback datasets.
- Joint training trains the model on both formats to enable cross-format functionality.
- Weight merging combines models trained on different data sets to create the final evaluator LM.
- Prometheus 2 models show strong correlations with human evaluators in direct assessment results.
- Prometheus 2 models achieve the highest scores across all benchmarks in pairwise ranking results.
- Consistency across evaluation formats is crucial for evaluator language models.
- Weight merging leads to superior performance compared to joint training and single format training.
- Positive task transfer from weight merging stems from unifying different evaluation formats.
- Training on pairwise ranking leads to a more significant improvement in direct assessment performance.
