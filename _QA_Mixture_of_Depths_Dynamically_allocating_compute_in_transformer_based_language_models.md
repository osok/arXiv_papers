# SUMMARY
The paper proposes a method to reduce compute in language modeling using a conditional computation technique called mixture of depths (mod) Transformers, dynamically allocating resources per token per layer.

# IDEAS:
- Mod Transformers dynamically allocate compute resources per token per layer in a Transformer network.
- Tokens can undergo computations or bypass them through a residual connection, saving compute.
- Learned routing decisions help mod Transformers allocate compute resources only where needed.
- Mod Transformers achieve equal or better performance with a smaller compute budget.
- The method reduces memory footprint and flops per forward pass, improving hardware efficiency.
- Mod Transformers use a per-block router to decide which tokens to process.
- The technique allows for a trade-off between performance and speed.
- Mod Transformers optimize compute usage by dynamically allocating resources based on token needs.
- Mixture of experts (Mo) Transformers route tokens to different expert MLPs for processing.
- Mod Transformers route tokens within the same block to either engage in computations or take a shortcut.
- Mo Transformers have constant compute expenditure, while mod Transformers can reduce it.
- Conditional computation dynamically determines when and how much computation to expend.
- Mod technique enables skipping unnecessary computations, reducing flops per forward pass.
- Learned routing mechanisms are crucial for conditional computation in mod Transformers.
- Dynamic computation graphs allow for a static compute budget, leading to hardware efficiency gains.
- Static compute budget ensures reduced memory footprint and fewer flops per forward pass.
- Token Choice routing can lead to load balancing issues, while Expert Choice routing ensures balance.
- Expert Choice routing helps prioritize critical tokens, improving model performance.
- Non-causal top-K operation in autoregressive sampling is addressed with auxiliary loss and MLP predictor.
- Mod Transformers achieve lower loss and faster training times compared to baseline models.
- Reducing block capacity and implementing learned routing decisions improve performance and speed.
- Aggressive capacity reduction with frequent full capacity computations leads to better performance.
- Stochastic routing performs worse than learned routing in mod Transformers.
- Optimal mod Transformer uses as many flops as the isoflop optimal baseline model.
- Adding depth rather than width is more beneficial when adding flops to the model.
- Mod Transformers exhibit memory savings at larger sizes, requiring fewer devices for training.
- Integration of mod with Mo models shows compounding performance improvements.
- Integrated mode approach outperforms staged mode and conventional Mo models.
- Routing machinery in mod Transformers provides flexibility in adjusting computation types and costs.
