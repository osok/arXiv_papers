# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the challenges of training language models (LMs) in specialized fields due to data labeling difficulties. It explores "easy to hard generalization," where models trained on simpler data perform well on harder test data, suggesting cost-effective training strategies.

# IDEAS:
- Training language models in specialized fields faces challenges due to data labeling difficulties.
- Easy to hard generalization involves training models on simpler data and testing on harder data.
- Models trained on easy data can perform almost as well as those trained on hard data.
- The supervision Gap recovered (SGR) measures model performance from easy to hard data.
- SGR is 100% when easy data training is as effective as hard data training.
- SGR is 0% when easy data training performs no better than no training.
- Models generally perform well from easy to hard data, with SGR between 70% and 100%.
- Training on easy data can be more cost-effective than training on hard data.
- Easy to hard generalization is robust across different model scales.
- Performance may decline when the gap between training and testing difficulty is too large.
- Curriculum learning traditionally focuses on the order of training data.
- Compositional generalization explores how models combine reasoning steps not seen during training.
- Neural networks struggle with problems requiring more reasoning steps than seen during training.
- Easy to hard generalization provides context for understanding scalable oversight problems.
- Human-based difficulty measures capture different aspects of data point difficulty.
- Model-based difficulty measures differ from human-based measures.
- Training on easy data can outperform hard data under certain cost assumptions.
- Label noise in hard data can make easy data training more effective.
- Larger models do not necessarily make supervision more challenging.
- Performance declines when the difficulty gap between training and testing increases.
- Models can solve difficult problems with few easy examples, encouraging truthfulness in answers.

# INSIGHTS:
- Easy to hard generalization can make training language models more cost-effective and efficient.
- Human-based difficulty measures are diverse and capture different aspects of problem hardness.
- Training on easy data can be surprisingly effective for difficult test problems.
- Label noise in hard data can make easy data a better training option.
- Larger models do not necessarily complicate supervision tasks.
- Performance declines when the difficulty gap between training and testing is too large.
- Curriculum learning and compositional generalization offer insights into model training strategies.
- Easy to hard generalization provides useful context for scalable oversight problems.
- Models can efficiently learn to solve hard problems from easy data examples.
- Encouraging truthfulness in answers can improve model performance across different domains.
