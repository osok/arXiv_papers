# SUMMARY
Open Elm, a family of large language models, uses layerwise scaling to optimize parameter distribution across Transformer layers, achieving superior performance with fewer resources.

# IDEAS:
- Open Elm introduces layerwise scaling to optimize parameter distribution across Transformer layers.
- Layerwise scaling uses smaller dimensions in early layers, increasing towards the output.
- Open Elm outperforms other open LLMs pre-trained on public datasets.
- A model with 1.1 billion parameters outperforms one with 1.2 billion by 2.36%.
- Open Elm uses a decoder-only Transformer-based design.
- The model does not use learnable bias parameters in fully connected layers.
- RMS Norm is applied for pre-normalization in Open Elm.
- Rotatory positional embedding (RoPE) is used for positional information.
- Grouped query attention (GQA) replaces multi-head attention (MHA).
- Flash attention is utilized for scaled dot product attention.
- The same tokenizer as LLaMA is adopted in Open Elm.
- Non-uniform parameter allocation is achieved by varying Transformer layer configurations.
- Scaling parameters Alpha and Beta customize attention heads and FFN multipliers per layer.
- Pre-training uses public datasets like refined web pile, Red Pajama, and Dolma v1.6.
- On-the-fly tokenization and data filtering are performed during pre-training.
- Character-level and token-level filtering exclude sequences below specific thresholds.
- Training involved 350,000 iterations using CoreT and AdamW optimizer.
- A cosine learning rate schedule with a warm-up of 5,000 iterations was used.
- Weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping of 1.0 were applied during training.
- Four variants of Open Elm were trained: 270M, 450M, 1.1B, and 3B.
- Evaluation included tasks like ARC, BullQ, HSwag, PIQA, SAQ, and Grande.
- Zero-shot and few-shot performance showed improvement with longer training durations.
- Averaging the last five checkpoints showed comparable or better accuracy than the final checkpoint.
- Instruction tuning improved average accuracy by 1 to 2%.
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and DoRA were effective.
- Token throughput was measured using prompt processing and token generation.
- Despite higher accuracy, Open Elm was slower than MMO due to RMS Norm implementation.
- Replacing basic RMS Norm with Apex's RMS Norm improved throughput but not enough.
- Future work aims to explore optimization strategies for better inference efficiency.
