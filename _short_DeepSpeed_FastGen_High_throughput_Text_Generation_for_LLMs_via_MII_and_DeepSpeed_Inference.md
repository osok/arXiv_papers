- Short prompts are composed to fill a target token budget, improving continuous batching.
- Token composition strategy dynamic split-fuse ensures consistent forward size by combining partial tokens.
- DeepSpeed FastGen achieves up to 2.3x higher effective throughput compared to existing LLM serving systems.
- DeepSpeed FastGen achieves up to 2x lower latency on average compared to VM.
- Replica-level load balancing distributes requests evenly across multiple servers.
- Linear scalability is achieved with DeepSpeed FastGen.
- Implementation details include supported models, deployment options, and advanced installation information.
- Future improvements and contributions from the DeepSpeed team and open-source projects are acknowledged.
