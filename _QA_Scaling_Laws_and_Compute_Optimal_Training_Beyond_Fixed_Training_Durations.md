# SUMMARY
The proposed method addresses the necessity of the cosine learning rate schedule in large language model training by introducing a constant learning rate followed by a cooldown phase.

# IDEAS:
- The method questions the necessity of the cosine schedule for optimal performance in large language model training.
- It introduces a constant learning rate followed by a cooldown phase as an alternative.
- The goal is to provide a more flexible and efficient training method.
- The method allows continual learning and easier experimentation with different data mixtures.
- It avoids the need to retrain models from scratch multiple times.
- The proposed method aims to simplify the training process and reduce computational costs.
- It provides comparable or better performance than the cosine schedule.
- The constant learning rate with cooldown matches the performance of the cosine schedule.
- Flexibility is offered by not requiring the number of training steps to be specified in advance.
- The cooldown can be initiated at any time to observe model behavior and decide whether to stop.
- The constant learning rate with a short cooldown achieves the same final loss as a well-tuned cosine schedule.
- The cooldown length can be less than 20% of the total training steps for long training runs.
- The method significantly reduces computational resources required for scaling experiments.
- Scaling laws can be conducted for only a fraction of the previous cost, saving both time and flops.
- Experimental results show that the cooldown learning rate schedule scales reliably similar to cosine and stochastic weight averaging.
- The performance of models trained with the cooldown schedule aligns closely with those trained using the cosine schedule.
- The constant learning rate with cooldown approach offers enhanced flexibility in training.
- It allows for continual learning and data mixture adjustments.
- It delivers comparable or superior performance to the cosine schedule in terms of model quality and scaling behavior.
- The performance is validated by training a range of model sizes across different token scales on the same dataset.
- Validation loss envelopes are plotted as a function of training flops.
- Models' performance is compared with cosine and its alternatives.
- Results show that the constant learning rate with cooldown schedule scales reliably and achieves optimal losses similar to cosine and weight averaging.
- Significant computational savings are reported by utilizing the constant learning rate with cooldown method.
- Stochastic weight averaging (SWA) provides a significant performance boost on top of a constant learning rate but does not reach the loss values of cooldowns at intermediate steps.
- SWA shows a similar boost on top of a cosine schedule, suggesting it offers a compelling approach to achieving strong models along the data scale axis.
- SWA improves performance along the training trajectory and provides better models during training.
- SWA serves as a replacement for models trained with fewer steps if the performance gap is acceptable and one wishes to avoid cooldowns.
- SWA offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the cooldown schedule and cosine schedule in large language model training.
- Limitations include focus on models up to 360M parameters and training on up to 10B tokens, acknowledging behavior may change at modern scale.
- The approach has been successful at larger scales for released models.
- The paper exclusively focuses on training or validation loss while downstream tasks are the main metric of interest.

# INSIGHTS:

- Comparable or superior performance to cosine schedule achieved with constant learning rate and cooldown.
- Significant computational savings reported using constant learning rate with cooldown method.
- Stochastic weight averaging boosts performance but doesn't match cooldowns at intermediate steps.
