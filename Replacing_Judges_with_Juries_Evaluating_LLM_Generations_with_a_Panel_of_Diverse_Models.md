# SUMMARY
The text discusses evaluating generative language models, highlighting traditional metrics' limitations and proposing a panel of diverse LLM evaluators for more reliable assessments.

# IDEAS:
- Evaluating generative language models is challenging due to data suitability and response accuracy.
- Multiple choice datasets like MML simplify evaluation but differ from real-world generative tasks.
- Traditional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and F1 often fail to capture desired properties.
- QA metrics can result in false positives and negatives due to reference answer limitations.
- Trained or prompted models show better correlation with human judgments than traditional metrics.
- Large evaluator models like GPT-4 have biases and favor their own outputs.
- Using large models as evaluators is slow and expensive, limiting practicality.
- A panel of LLM evaluators from various model families can reduce biases.
- Aggregating judgments from diverse evaluators aligns better with human judgments.
- Single large judges like GPT-4 show high variability with minor prompt changes.
- Different scoring methods include single-point, reference-based, and pairwise scoring.
- A panel of evaluators provides a more robust assessment by mitigating judgment variations.
- Each evaluator independently scores a model output, combined using a voting function.
- Pooling judgments from diverse models achieves more reliable and cost-effective evaluations.
- Max voting is used for binary QA datasets; average pooling for chatbot Arena scores.
- Models from various families like Command R, GPT, Claude 3, and Mistol are included.
- Single-hop QA tasks require evidence retrieval and answer generation based on questions.
- Multihop QA tasks involve multiple rounds of retrieval to answer questions effectively.
- Chatbot Arena benchmarks model performance in generating responses using challenging prompts.
- Human judgments from Chatbot Arena serve as the ground truth for evaluating model performance.
- Reference-based scoring and examples of valid/invalid QA pairs prompt judge models appropriately.
- Cohen's Kappa correlation measures agreement between evaluator judges and human judgments.
- Poll shows the strongest correlation across various tasks compared to GPT-4.
- Kendall Tau and Pearson correlation compare judge model rankings with human judgment rankings.
- Poll demonstrates better correlation with ground truth rankings, especially at the top of the list.
- Reducing bias in evaluation is crucial by using a panel of diverse models instead of a single judge.
- Poll has the smallest spread in scores, indicating higher consistency compared to individual judges.
- Running Poll is significantly less expensive and faster than using a single GPT-4 judge.

# INSIGHTS:
- Diverse LLM evaluators reduce biases and align better with human judgments than single large models.
- Traditional metrics often fail to capture the nuanced properties of generative language models.
- Using a panel of evaluators provides a more robust and cost-effective assessment method.
- Aggregating judgments from diverse models mitigates variations and errors in evaluations.
- Single large judges like GPT-4 exhibit high variability with minor prompt changes.
