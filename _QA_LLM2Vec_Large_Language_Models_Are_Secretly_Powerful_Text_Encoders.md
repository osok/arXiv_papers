# SUMMARY
The proposed method, LLM Tove, aims to transform pre-trained decoder-only language models into universal text encoders for text embedding tasks by addressing architectural limitations.

# IDEAS:
- LLM Tove transforms pre-trained decoder-only language models into universal text encoders for text embedding tasks.
- The method addresses the architectural limitation of decoder-only LLMs' causal attention mechanism.
- Causal attention restricts token interactions, limiting the ability to capture information across the entire input sequence.
- Enabling bidirectional attention allows each token access to every other token in the sequence.
- Masked next token prediction (MNTP) trains the model to predict masked tokens based on past and future context.
- Unsupervised contrastive learning (Sim CSSE) maximizes similarity between two representations of the same sequence.
- LLM Tove enhances the model's ability to produce rich contextualized token representations without labeled data.
- The approach is highly data and parameter efficient for transforming decoder-only LLMs into effective text encoders.
- Decoder-only LLMs learn from all input tokens during pre-training, making them sample efficient.
- Instruction fine-tuning and learning from human preferences improve decoder-only LLMs' instruction-following capabilities.
- Enabling bidirectional attention without further adaptation decreases embedding performance for most models.
- Mistral 7B shows resilience to bidirectional attention, even improving performance in named entity recognition tasks.
- Sim CSSE ensures the model captures the context of the entire sequence, not just individual tokens.
- Sim CSSE does not require paired data and can be applied using any collection of sequences.
- Constructing token representations with causal attention outperforms encoder-only baselines on word-level tasks.
- Further adapting models via MNTP improves performance for all models and tasks.
- Combining MNTP with Sim CSSE performs worse than just applying MNTP for word-level tasks.
- LLM Tove leads to significant improvements in performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTE).
- Mistral 7B achieves a state-of-the-art score of 56.80 on the MTE, surpassing other unsupervised models.
- The method is effective in producing strong text embeddings for a variety of tasks.
