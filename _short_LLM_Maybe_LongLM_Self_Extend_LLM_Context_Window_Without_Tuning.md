# SUMMARY
The paper discusses positional embeddings in Transformers, introduces rotary position embedding (rope), and proposes the self-extend method to handle long input sequences in language models.

# IDEAS:
- Absolute position embeddings and relative positional encodings are primary types of positional embedding designs.
- Rotary position embedding (rope) integrates positional information into query and key vectors.
- Rope effectively captures relative positional embedding information in language models.
- Long input sequences exceed pre-training context windows, causing out-of-distribution issues.
- Attention distributions for unseen relative positions differ from pre-training context windows.
- Group attention with the floor operation maps new relative positions into seen ones.
- Floor operation maintains order information among tokens in self-attention mechanisms.
- Floor operation is applied before the inner product in self-attention mechanisms.
- Language modeling performance is measured using perplexity (PPL) on the PG19 dataset.
- LLMS with floor operations achieve relatively good PPL despite slight degradation with small group sizes.
- Reintroducing normal attention in the neighbor area improves language modeling ability.
- Neighbor tokens are crucial for generating the next token and ensuring fluency.
- Attention mechanism remains unchanged for neighbor tokens.
- Self-extend method combines group attention and normal attention to extend context windows.
- Self-extend does not require fine-tuning or training for extended context windows.
- Maximum length of extended context window is determined by pre-training context window size.
- Group size for group attention and window size for neighbor tokens determine context window length.
- Self-extend method improves handling of long input sequences by LLMS.
- Self-extend maintains language modeling performance without fine-tuning.
