# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling long contexts and introduces a method called self-extend to address this issue without fine-tuning.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs have limited context window length due to fixed-length training sequences.
- Performance degrades significantly when input text exceeds pre-training context window.
- Fine-tuning on longer texts is a common but resource-intensive method to extend context windows.
- Some methods avoid fine-tuning but rely on local information, limiting effectiveness.
- Positional out-of-distribution (OOD) issues arise when LLMs encounter longer sequences than trained on.
- Self-extend maps unseen large relative positions to known ones using floor division.
- Human experience suggests LLMs should inherently handle long contexts.
- Self-extend is a plug-and-play method working at the inference stage.
- Self-extend uses grouped attention for distant tokens and normal attention for neighboring tokens.
- Tested on Llama 2, Mistal, and Solar models, self-extend showed significant improvements.
- Self-extend outperforms fine-tuning methods on various tasks.
- Positional OOD issues are the main challenge for LLMs handling long contexts.
- Self-extend maintains coherence over longer texts without additional fine-tuning.
- Grouped attention maintains order information among tokens.
- Normal attention reintroduced in neighbor areas to reconstruct degraded language modeling ability.
- Self-extend extends context window without affecting short context task performance.
- Evaluated on real-world benchmarks Long Bench and Lofal, self-extend showed improved performance.
- Self-extend performed comparably or better than fine-tuned models on several datasets.
- Larger context windows may compromise position precision.
- Self-extend dynamically disables for short text sequences, maintaining original performance.
- Ablation study shows group size and neighbor window size affect performance.

# INSIGHTS:
- LLMs' poor performance with long texts is due to positional OOD issues, not lack of capability.
- Self-extend leverages inherent long-context capabilities of LLMs without fine-tuning.
- Grouped attention and normal attention balance long-distance and local token relationships.
- Human learning from short texts suggests LLMs can adapt similarly with proper methods.
- Positional encoding challenges can be mitigated by mapping unseen positions to known ones.

# QUOTES:
- "LLMs have a limited context window length which leads to unpredictable behavior and performance degradation."
- "Self-extend uses a simple floor division operation to map unseen large relative positions."
- "We believe that the poor performance of LLMs with long texts is not due to a lack of long context understanding capabilities."
- "Self-extend is a plug-and-play method that works at the inference stage."
- "Self-extend significantly improves the long context understanding ability and even outperforms fine-tuning based methods."
- "LLMs with relative positional encoding naturally have the ability to handle long texts."
- "The previous limitation comes from out-of-distribution positions."
- "Self-extend can achieve comparable or even better performance than many existing fine-tuning based models."
- "Grouped attention maintains the order information among tokens."
- "Normal attention reintroduced in the neighbor area to reconstruct degraded language modeling ability."
- "Self-extend doesn't significantly affect the performance on short context tasks."
- "This makes self-extend a dynamic plugin that can be automatically disabled when dealing with short text sequences."
- "Human experience suggests that LLMs should inherently handle long contexts."
- "Positional OOD issues are the main challenge for preventing LLMs from effectively handling long contexts."
- "Self-extend dynamically disables for short text sequences, maintaining original performance."

# HABITS:
