# SUMMARY
The work focuses on improving the factuality assessment of large language models (LLMs) using new tools: Long Fact, SAFE, and a novel metric.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs often make factual errors, undermining their reliability in precise information scenarios.
- Long Fact is a new prompt set with 2,280 prompts across 38 topics for evaluating long-form factuality.
- SAFE is a method that uses LLMs to automatically evaluate the factuality of long-form responses.
- SAFE decomposes responses into individual facts and checks their accuracy using Google search queries.
- The metric "2 number two" evaluates both precision and recall of factual information in responses.
- Larger LLMs generally exhibit better long-form factuality compared to smaller models.
- SAFE achieves high accuracy compared to human annotators in evaluating long-form factuality.
- SAFE agreed with human annotations on 72% of individual facts, indicating human-level performance.
- SAFE annotations were correct 76% of the time when reannotated using Google search.
- Human annotations were correct only 19% of the time in cases where they disagreed with SAFE.
- SAFE proved cost-effective, costing $0.19 per model response compared to $4 for human annotations.
- LLM agents outperform humans in factuality annotation tasks and achieve superhuman performance.
- The F1 at K metric combines factual precision and recall for evaluating response quality.
- Larger models like GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini Ultra perform better in long-form factuality.
- Newer models like Gemini and Claude 3 show promising performance comparable to older models like GPT-4.
- SAFE offers an automatic, reliable, and cost-effective way to assess long-form factuality.
- SAFE relies on Google search for ground truth information, which may not be comprehensive in specialized domains.
- Future research could explore alternative methods for determining global factuality beyond Google search.
- The "2 number two" metric assumes responses do not contain repeated facts, which could be exploited.
- Implementing a step to remove duplicated facts in SAFE could be beneficial but requires further research.
