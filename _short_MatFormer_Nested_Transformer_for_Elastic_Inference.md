# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the Matte Former model, leveraging a nested structure to enhance Transformer models' performance and flexibility.

# IDEAS:
- Matte Former model uses a novel nested structure to improve Transformer-based models' performance and flexibility.
- The structure consists of G Transformer blocks, each a subset of the subsequent block, indicating hierarchy.
- Feed Forward Network (FFN) block is the basis, with a matrioska nested structure of G granularities.
- Nested subblocks, denoted as tore I, contain neurons represented by mcore I, increasing with each subblock.
- Four exponentially spaced granularities with FFN ratios of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 are chosen.
- Stacking these subblocks for L layers forms the Matte Former model, denoted as m _ I equal tore I karat L.
- Input and output embedding matrices are shared across all models for efficient computation.
- Jointly optimizing all G nested submodels with a weighted average training loss benefits shared computation.
- Training strategy outperforms various other techniques by leveraging shared computation during back propagation.
- Mix and match procedure allows generating accurate smaller models by selecting different granularities.
- Interpolating blocks between fixed granularities increases the number of extracted models.
- Flexibility enables extracting highly accurate models within a given computational budget for deployment.
- Only the single Universal Matte Former model needs to be stored, eliminating multiple models for elastic inference.
- For static workloads, the most accurate static submodel can be chosen using mix and match.
- For dynamic workloads, the Universal Matte Former model dynamically extracts the optimal submodel for token-based routing.
- Highly consistent nature minimizes prediction drift across different submodels and cross-platform deployments.
- Higher model consistency helps preserve metric space structure in encoder models.
- Matte Former model introduces a nested structure and simple training strategy for improved performance and flexibility.
- Mix and match procedure allows extraction of accurate smaller models while enabling efficient deployment.
