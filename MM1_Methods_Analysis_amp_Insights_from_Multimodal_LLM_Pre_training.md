# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combining image and text data, highlighting architecture decisions, pre-training data choices, and performance metrics.

# IDEAS:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine image and text data to produce text outputs.
- MLLMs are seen as the next frontier in foundation models after large language models (LLMs).
- Closed models lack detailed information about data, model architecture, and training procedures.
- Open models release model parameters and comprehensive descriptions of data and training setups.
- Limited insights exist into algorithmic design choices in multimodal pre-training.
- Distilling principles and lessons on constructing models can outlast specific implementations.
- Key trends identified include image resolution, visual encoder loss, and pre-training data choices.
- Architectural decisions on visual data input have minimal impact on model performance.
- Three types of pre-training data: image caption, interleaved image-text, and Texton data.
- Interleaved and Texton training data are crucial for few-shot and Texton performance.
- Caption data is most important for zero-shot performance.
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) maintains trends across various evaluations.
- Scaling up models using larger LLMs and mixture of experts (MoE) models enhances performance.
- Pre-trained model MM1 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in captioning and visual question answering (VQA).
- Effective large-scale multimodal pre-training develops competitive MLLMs with strong few-shot learning capabilities.
- Empirical exploration focuses on architecture, data, and training procedures.
- Simplified setup for experiments starts with a smaller base model configuration.
- Incremental changes to components like architectural modules or data sources refine the model.
- Contrastive losses lead to strong semantic understanding of images.
- Reconstructive losses benefit tasks requiring detailed image comprehension.
- Image resolution, model size, and training data composition impact model performance.
- Number of visual tokens and image resolution significantly impact performance.
- Carefully considering design decisions is crucial in building effective MLLMs.
- Pre-training uses large-scale web data; fine-tuning focuses on task-specific data.
- Captioning data improves zero-shot performance; interleaved data is crucial for few-shot performance.
- Combining Texton data with captioning enhances few-shot performance.
- Synthetic caption data (VCAP) boosts few-shot performance despite being smaller in quantity.
