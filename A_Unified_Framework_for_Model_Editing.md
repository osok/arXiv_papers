# IDEAS:
- Model editing is essential for updating facts stored within a model.
- Two main types of model editing: adding information in context and modifying model parameters.
- Integrated gradients can identify knowledge-containing neurons for model editing.
- Training additional models for each source model is required in some methods.
- Parameter-modifying methods aim to insert new knowledge into model weights universally.
- Rank-One Model Editing and Mass Editing Memory in Transformers are promising techniques.
- Mass Editing Memory in Transformer allows for batched edits.
- Preservation Memorization objective focuses on injecting new knowledge while preserving vector representations.
- Edit distribution algorithms are crucial for effective model editing.
- EMT (Equality Constrained Mass Model Editing) allows for batched editing under an equality constraint.
- EMT performs well for small batch sizes but struggles with larger ones.
- Preservation Memorization unifies Rome and Meit model editing methods.
- Rome uses an equality constraint, while Meit uses a least square objective.
- Edit distribution algorithms become crucial for larger batch sizes.
- GPT-J performs exceptionally well with edit distribution algorithms.
- Edit distribution algorithms may not always improve editing outcomes.
- Further research into edit distribution algorithms is needed.
- EMT unifies Rome and Meit under the Preservation Memorization objective.
- EMT is viable for large-scale model editing with smaller batch sizes.
- EMT is made available to the research community for further exploration.

# INSIGHTS:
- Model editing is crucial for keeping LLMs updated with the latest knowledge.
- Parameter-modifying methods can universally insert new knowledge into any LLM.
- Preservation Memorization objective balances injecting new knowledge and preserving existing facts.
- Edit distribution algorithms are essential for effective batched edits in large models.
- EMT offers a closed-form solution for batched editing under equality constraints.
