# SUMMARY
The text discusses how Stepwise Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO) enhances alignment in training large language models (LLMs) using preference data sets and aligned reference models.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP) through pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and alignment tuning.
- Alignment tuning is crucial for ensuring the safety and usefulness of LLMs.
- Reinforcement learning techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are important during the alignment phase.
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning in LLM training.
- DPO involves creating preference data sets using human or strong AI judgment to choose preferred responses.
- Obtaining probabilities with models like GPT-4 can be challenging as they do not provide log probabilities.
- A weaker model like the base SFT model is often used as the reference model in DPO.
- Using a more aligned reference model would be better for DPO training and alignment tuning.
- Open-source models that have undergone alignment tuning can be used as reference models.
- Stepwise DPO (SDPO) uses preference data sets in a step-by-step manner during DPO training.
- The aligned model from the previous step serves as the reference model in SDPO.
- SDPO results in a better final aligned model compared to traditional methods.
- SDPO can be easily applied to any preference data and combined with other methods.
- Using an already aligned reference model like Intel 7BD results in the best performance.
- The reference model's alignment is significant in achieving a high-performing aligned model.
- SDPO leverages more aligned reference models in the training process.
- The reference model is initialized as the aligned model from the previous step in SDPO.
- The target model is also initialized as the aligned model from the previous step in SDPO.
- SDPO ensures that the final model is trained with the same amount of data as a model trained with DPO.
- SDPO aims to improve the performance of the final aligned model by using more aligned reference models.
- Employing a well-aligned reference model leads to better model performance compared to larger but less aligned models.
- The goal of SDPO is to minimize the DPO loss by ensuring that the log ratio of chosen and rejected answers is greater than that set by the reference model.
- SDPO induces a curriculum learning approach from easy to hard tasks for training.
- Using different preference data sets proves to be the most effective in SDPO experiments.
- The specific way of splitting the DPO data impacts performance in SDPO.
- A single step of SDPO significantly improves alignment, leading to a more effective aligned model.
- Initializing the target model with the previous aligned model ensures consistent training with the same data amount.
- Initializing the target model with the base model resulted in a higher initial loss compared to using the previous aligned model.
