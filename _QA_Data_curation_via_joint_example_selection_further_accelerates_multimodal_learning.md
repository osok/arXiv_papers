# SUMMARY
The new method, Joint Example Selection (JEST), aims to solve inefficient and costly manual curation of large-scale datasets for pre-training models by introducing a model-based data curation approach.

# IDEAS:
- JEST accelerates learning in multimodal tasks by selecting highly learnable batches from larger super batches.
- The method addresses slow and power law scaling of large-scale pre-training.
- JEST prioritizes examples that are both unlearned and learnable, improving training efficiency and performance.
- It enables the utilization of small curated datasets to guide the curation of larger datasets.
- JEST uses model-based scoring functions to score sub-batches based on losses from learner models.
- Three scoring heuristics are used: hard learner, easy reference, and learnability.
- Hard learner prioritizes batches with high loss under the learner model.
- Easy reference prioritizes data that is easy for a pre-trained reference model.
- Learnability combines scores to upsample data that is unlearned and learnable.
- JEST samples batches in proportion to their joint learnability.
- Efficient scoring and multi-resolution training are leveraged for gains in efficiency.
- Data quality bootstrapping uses a pre-trained reference model to guide larger dataset curation.
- JEST surpasses the quality of the reference model on downstream tasks.
- The method significantly accelerates large-scale multimodal learning.
- JEST achieves up to 10 times fewer flops and 13 times fewer examples than previous methods.
- It simplifies data curation by eliminating the need for foundation datasets.
- The method is validated through experiments comparing it to state-of-the-art models.
- JEST outperforms previous models on ImageNet and COCO datasets with fewer iterations and compute.
- The most training-efficient model, JEST+, achieved new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and COCO.
- Flexi+, the most compute-efficient model, surpassed previous state-of-the-art using nine times less compute.
- The method's effectiveness depends on the quality of small curated reference datasets.
- Online batch selection may introduce computational overhead and complexity when scaling up.
- Performance gains are primarily demonstrated in multimodal learning tasks.
