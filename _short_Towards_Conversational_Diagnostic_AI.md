# IDEAS:
- Amy is an AI model designed specifically for medical dialogues and reasoning.
- The training data included multiple-choice medical questions, expert-curated long-form medical reasoning, and EHR note summaries.
- The MedQA dataset, comprising USMLE-style questions, was used for medical reasoning.
- Clinical experts crafted step-by-step reasoning for the MedQA questions to ensure accuracy.
- Expert-crafted long-form responses to medical questions were used to enhance Amy's capabilities.
- Clinician-written summaries of medical notes were used to improve Amy's summarization skills.
- A deidentified dataset of medical conversations during clinical visits was incorporated for training.
- A self-play based simulated learning environment was designed for diagnostic medical dialogues.
- The self-play environment involved an inner loop and an outer loop for refining Amy's behavior.
- The inner loop involved simulated conversations with an AI patient agent.
- The outer loop incorporated refined simulated dialogues into subsequent fine-tuning iterations.
- Task-specific instructions were used to fine-tune Amy's capabilities for medical dialogue and reasoning.
- Amy employed a chain of reasoning strategy before generating responses in each dialogue turn.
- The chain of reasoning involved analyzing patient information, formulating a response, and refining it.
- Amy's performance was evaluated through a randomized crossover study of online text-based consultations.
- The consultations were evaluated by patient actors, specialist physicians, and model-based auto-evaluation methods.
- The use of diverse real-world datasets ensured Amy's robustness across various medical conditions and contexts.
- The self-play learning environment allowed Amy to scale its knowledge effectively.
