# SUMMARY
The paper investigates how fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with new factual knowledge impacts their tendency to hallucinate, focusing on training dynamics and performance.

# IDEAS:
- Fine-tuning LLMs with new knowledge can lead to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect responses.
- The study categorizes examples into known and unknown to assess their impact on model performance.
- Matha highly known examples are always predicted correctly by the model.
- Matha maybe known examples are sometimes predicted correctly by the model.
- Matha weekly known examples are never predicted correctly by the model.
- Learning from unknown examples correlates with a higher tendency for hallucinations.
- Learning from known examples leads to better utilization of pre-existing knowledge.
- LLMs fit unknown examples substantially slower than known examples.
- Fine-tuning on Matha highly known examples does not yield the best overall results.
- Fine-tuning on Matha maybe known examples results in the best overall performance.
- Fine-tuning on Matha weekly known examples increases the risk of overfitting.
- The composition of fine-tuning examples significantly influences LLMs' performance.
- Early stopping can empirically avoid the negative impact of unknown examples.
- Filtering out unknown fine-tuning examples can reduce the risk of overfitting.
- Relabeling unknown examples with uncertainty expressions could mitigate harmful effects.
- Aligning fine-tuning data with the model's knowledge enhances performance and avoids hallucinations.
- The study emphasizes the importance of training dynamics in integrating new factual knowledge.
- Unknown examples primarily cause performance degradation in later training stages.
- Early stopping helps mitigate hallucinations caused by fitting unknown examples.
- Removing unknown examples has a neutral effect on early-stage performance but is harmful later.
