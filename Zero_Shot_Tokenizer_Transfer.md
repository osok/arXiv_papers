# SUMMARY
The text discusses zero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZTT) for language models, enabling them to switch tokenizers without retraining. A hyper network predicts embedding parameters for any tokenizer, preserving model performance.

# IDEAS:
- Language models typically rely on tokenizers to map text into a sequence of tokens.
- Once trained with a specific tokenizer, models are limited to that tokenizer.
- This limitation hinders adaptability to different languages or specialized domains.
- Zero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZTT) aims to detach models from their original tokenizers.
- ZTT enables efficient transfer to new tokenizers without prior data observation.
- A hyper network predicts embedding parameters for any given tokenizer.
- This approach preserves model performance with minimal additional training data.
- ZTT offers a competitive solution for transferring models across tokenizers.
- Combining language models with different tokenizers unlocks new possibilities.
- The hyper network is trained on various tokenizers to predict embedding parameters.
- This method detaches language models from their original tokenizer.
- The hyper network-based approach provides a cutting-edge solution for token transfer.
- The auxiliary loss penalizes deviations from the warm-up stage embeddings.
- The final loss combines the main loss and the auxiliary loss with a weighting parameter.
- The hyper network architecture maps the tokenizer to the embedding parameters.
- New tokens are decomposed using the original tokenization function and embeddings.
- The hyper network learns to generate a single embedding suitable for different tokenizations.
- Token decomposition can be complex, especially with byte-level tokenizers.
- Extra tokens are added to the vocabulary to ensure valid UTF-8 sequences.
- Hyper network training uses a 7:3 ratio of English to code data.
- Multilingual evaluation involves training language-specific tokenizers with a 50K vocabulary size.
- Hyper network training involves 200k gradient update steps with a batch size of 128 tokens.
- The hyper network uses a Roberta-style architecture with bidirectional attention.
- Zero-shot results show the hyper network outperforms baselines, maintaining accuracy within 1%.
- Sequences are approximately 14% shorter on average for language-specific tokenizers.
- Continued training with the target tokenizer almost completely closes performance gaps.
- Fine-tuned models' embedding space is compatible with base models for hyper network predictions.
- Converting tokenizers to byte-level and unigram LM simplifies tokenizer transfer research.
