# SUMMARY
The text discusses zero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZTT) for language models, enabling efficient switching between tokenizers without retraining. It introduces a hyper-network approach to predict embedding parameters for any tokenizer, preserving model performance with minimal additional training.

# IDEAS:
- Language models typically rely on tokenizers to map text into a sequence of tokens.
- Once trained with a specific tokenizer, models are limited to that tokenizer.
- This limitation hinders adaptability to different languages or specialized domains.
- Zero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZTT) aims to detach language models from their original tokenizers.
- ZTT enables efficient transfer to new tokenizers without prior data observation.
- A hyper-network is trained to predict embedding parameters for any given tokenizer.
- This approach preserves model performance with minimal additional training data.
- ZTT offers a competitive solution for transferring models across tokenizers.
- The methodology involves training hyper-networks to find parameters substituting original embeddings.
- Diverse tokenizers are sampled, and a warm-up stage and auxiliary loss facilitate training.
- The auxiliary loss penalizes deviations from the warm-up stage embeddings.
- The final loss combines main and auxiliary losses with a weighting parameter.
- Hyper-network architecture maps tokenizers to embedding parameters using original embeddings.
- The hyper-network learns to generate a single embedding suitable for various tokenization functions.
- Token decomposition challenges are addressed by converting tokenizers to byte level.
- Experiments use English and multilingual datasets for hyper-network training and evaluation.
- Hyper-network training involves gradient update steps, batch size, and sequence length specifications.
- Results show hyper-network outperforms baselines, maintaining accuracy within 1% on average.
- Sequences are approximately 14% shorter, resulting in over 16% faster inference.
- ZTT poses more challenges in decoder cases but shows significant progress in closing performance gaps.
- Continued training with the target tokenizer almost completely closes performance gaps.
- Fine-tuned models' embedding space is compatible with base models, allowing hyper-network predictions transfer.
- Conversion of tokenizers to byte level and unigram LM simplifies tokenizer transfer research.
- Computational overhead of the hyper-network increases with more layers in the main model.
