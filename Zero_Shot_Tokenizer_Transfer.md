# SUMMARY
The text discusses zero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZTT) for language models, enabling efficient transitions between tokenizers using a hyper network to predict embedding parameters.

# IDEAS:
- Language models typically work with discrete tokens and require a tokenizer to map text into sequences.
- Most language models today use subword tokenizers, while some use byte-level or character-level tokenizers.
- Once trained with a specific tokenizer, language models cannot be used with a different one.
- Switching between tokenizers can affect model performance, making tasks like ensembling challenging.
- Previous methods focused on retraining embedding parameters of a language model with a new tokenizer.
- Zero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZTT) aims to create an embedding matrix for any tokenizer without prior data observation.
- ZTT involves training a hyper network on various tokenizers to predict embedding parameters for a given tokenizer.
- This method detaches language models from their original tokenizer, enabling smoother transitions between tokenizers.
- ZTT has shown promising results in preserving model performance across different tokenizers with minimal additional training data.
- The hyper network-based approach provides a cutting-edge solution for transferring models between tokenizers.
- The methodology involves training hyper networks to find parameters that substitute original embedding parameters in a language model.
- The training loop involves updating the tokenizer based on the text queue and adding noise for variance.
- A warm-up stage mimics the original tokenizer's embedding parameters, followed by an auxiliary loss penalizing deviations.
- The final loss combines the main loss and auxiliary loss with a weighting parameter alpha.
- The hyper network architecture maps the tokenizer to embedding parameters by decomposing new tokens using the original tokenization function.
- The hyper network consists of a language model that learns to compose sequences of tokens into one embedding.
- Token decomposition can be complex, especially if the original tokenizer works at the character level.
- Converting tokenizers to byte-level by adding extra tokens ensures arbitrary tokens can be decomposed.
- Experiments use various benchmarks to assess the method, including natural language and code benchmarks.
- The hyper network consistently outperformed baselines, maintaining accuracy within 1% on average.
- Sequences were approximately 14% shorter on average for language-specific tokenizers, resulting in over 16% faster inference.
- Continued training with the target tokenizer almost completely closed performance gaps in some benchmarks.
- The embedding space of fine-tuned models is compatible with that of the base model, allowing predictions without additional training.
- Conversion of tokenizers to byte-level and unigram LM simplifies tokenizer transfer research.
