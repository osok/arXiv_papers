# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "infin attention," a novel attention mechanism for Transformer language models (LLMs) to process infinitely long inputs efficiently by incorporating compressive memory.

# IDEAS:
- Infin attention incorporates compressive memory into the standard attention mechanism of Transformers.
- The approach allows continual pre-training and fine-tuning for infinitely long contexts.
- It balances long and short-range contextual dependencies effectively.
- Standard attention mechanisms in Transformers have quadratic complexity in memory and computation.
- Transformers discard old key-value (KV) states, limiting context-dependent memory.
- Infin attention reuses old KV states in compressive memory instead of discarding them.
- This mechanism integrates masked local attention and long-term linear attention.
- It maintains the entire context history with a fixed number of memory parameters.
- The approach supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long context adaptation.
- Memory retrieval involves reusing query, key, and value states from dot-product attention.
- The update rule combines linear updates and the Delta rule for memory efficiency.
- Infin attention enables an unbounded context window with a bounded memory footprint.
- The model aggregates local attention states and memory-retrieved content via a learned gating scaler.
- Experiments showed a 4x compression ratio in memory size.
- The model scaled naturally to longer sequences like 1M tokens.
- It successfully solved tasks like passage retrieval and book summarization.
- Infin attention outperformed baseline models on long-context language modeling benchmarks.
- The approach addresses issues of attention sync and being lost in the middle.
- It ensures old KV states are reused, maintaining comprehensive context history.
- The design facilitates efficient long-context modeling through innovative memory management.
