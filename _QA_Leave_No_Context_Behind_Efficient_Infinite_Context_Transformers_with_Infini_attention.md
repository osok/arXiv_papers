# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "infin attention," a novel attention mechanism for Transformer language models (LLMs) to process infinitely long inputs efficiently using compressive memory.

# IDEAS:
- Infin attention incorporates compressive memory into the standard attention mechanism of Transformers.
- This approach allows continual pre-training and fine-tuning for infinitely long contexts.
- It balances long and short-range contextual dependencies effectively.
- The standard attention mechanism in Transformers has quadratic complexity in memory and computation.
- Infin attention reuses old key-value (KV) states instead of discarding them.
- The compressive memory enables the model to maintain a fixed number of memory parameters.
- Infin attention integrates masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms.
- The approach optimizes memory usage and improves contextual modeling.
- It supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long context adaptation.
- The memory retrieval process reuses query, key, and value states from dot-product attention.
- The update rule combines linear update and Delta rule for memory efficiency.
- Infin attention maintains a constant memory complexity for storing compressed context.
- The model aggregates local attention states and memory-retrieved content via a learned gating scaler.
- Incremental memory updates allow processing extremely long inputs in a streaming fashion.
- Experiments showed a 4x compression ratio in memory size.
- The model scaled naturally to longer sequence lengths like 1M tokens.
- It successfully solved tasks like passage retrieval and book summarization.
- Infin attention addresses issues of attention sync and being lost in the middle.
- Segment-level streaming computation over long sequences is enabled with a fixed local attention window.
- The approach ensures old KV states are reused, maintaining the entire context history.
