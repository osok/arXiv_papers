# SUMMARY
The authors discuss the evolution of neural networks, focusing on Transformers and their auto-regressive nature. They introduce Tova, a compression policy for Transformer decoders, which improves performance and reduces memory consumption.

# IDEAS:
- Transformers have replaced RNNs in natural language processing (NLP).
- Transformers can directly access each token in a sequence.
- Decoders generate output in an auto-regressive manner.
- Auto-regressive nature aligns with RNNs' core principle of maintaining state.
- Decoder-only Transformers can be redefined as multi-state RNNs (MS RNNs).
- Transformers can be seen as MS RNNs with infinite states.
- Compressing Transformers into finite MS RNNs limits tokens processed at each step.
- Tova selects tokens to keep based on attention scores.
- Tova outperforms existing policies with minimal performance degradation.
- Not all recent tokens are important to keep in memory.
- Keeping the first token and possessive nouns is crucial.
- Transformer decoders predict the next token using masking.
- Multi-state RNNs use a matrix of states instead of a single vector.
- Transformers are trained up to a specific length but can handle infinite inputs.
- Compression policies convert infinite MS RNNs into finite ones.
- FIFO strategy discards the oldest state when capacity is reached.
- Tova drops the token with the lowest attention score at each step.
- Tova performs better layer-wise than headwise.
- Tova achieves results similar to infinite MS RNN models.
- Pre-trained Transformers behave like finite MS RNNs in practice.
- Tova policy uses a quarter or an eighth of the full context length.
- Recent tokens are often preserved, but many older tokens are also kept.
- Punctuation, special symbols, possessive nouns, and proper nouns are retained longer.
- Increasing batch size using Tova improves hardware utilization.
- Hybrid approaches attend to recent tokens and hidden states simultaneously.
- Some models replace self-attention layers with convolution layers.
- Window attention constructs Transformers with limited cache requirements.
- Manually caching specific tokens boosts H2O performance.
- Dynamic attention in Transformers can be replaced with static weights.

# INSIGHTS:
- Transformers redefine sequential data processing by accessing each token directly.
- Auto-regressive decoding aligns with RNN principles, maintaining state across steps.
- Multi-state RNNs generalize traditional RNNs by using matrices of states.
- Compressing Transformers into finite MS RNNs optimizes memory usage.
- Tova's attention-based token selection enhances performance and efficiency.
- Initial tokens and possessive nouns play a critical role in decoding success.
- Pre-trained Transformers often function as finite MS RNNs despite infinite training capacity.
- Token retention varies, with punctuation and proper nouns kept longer.
- Increasing batch size via Tova significantly boosts hardware efficiency.
