# SUMMARY
The authors introduce Transformers as a replacement for RNNs in NLP, redefine decoder-only Transformers as multi-state RNNs (MS RNNs), and propose a compression policy called Tova to improve performance and reduce memory consumption.

# IDEAS:
- Transformers replaced RNNs in NLP due to their ability to access each token directly.
- Decoder-only Transformers generate output auto-regressively, similar to RNNs maintaining state.
- Redefining decoder-only Transformers as multi-state RNNs (MS RNNs) generalizes traditional RNNs.
- Transformers can be seen as MS RNNs with an infinite number of states.
- Compressing Transformers into finite MS RNNs limits the number of tokens processed at each step.
- Tova, a new MS RNN compression policy, selects tokens based on attention scores.
- Tova outperforms existing policies with minimal performance degradation, using only 14-18% of the context.
- Not all recent tokens are important; some can be safely dropped.
- Keeping the first token and possessive nouns is crucial for successful decoding.
- Transformer decoders predict the next token using masking and store K and V matrices.
- Multi-state RNNs use a matrix of states instead of a single vector.
- Transformers trained up to a specific length struggle to extrapolate beyond that length.
- Compression policies convert infinite MS RNNs into finite ones, improving efficiency.
- FIFO strategy discards the oldest state when multi-state reaches capacity.
- Tova retains top states based on attention weights of the last token only.
- Tova performs better layer-wise rather than headwise.
- Tova achieves results similar to infinite MS RNN models in language modeling and text generation tasks.
- Pre-trained Transformers behave like finite MS RNNs in practice.
- Limiting multi-state size results in shorter generated text but maintains comparable performance.
- Recent tokens are often preserved, but many older tokens are also kept.
- Punctuation, special symbols, possessive nouns, and proper nouns tend to be kept longer.
- Increasing batch size using Tova improves hardware utilization without significant performance loss.
