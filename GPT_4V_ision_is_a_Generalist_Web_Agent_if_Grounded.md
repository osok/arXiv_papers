# SUMMARY
The paper explores large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V and their potential as generalist web agents. It introduces SECT, a web agent leveraging LMMs for visual understanding and action generation on websites.

# IDEAS:
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V excel in vision and language tasks.
- Websites present a unique challenge for LMMs due to their complex visual design.
- SECT is proposed as a generalist web agent using LMMs for integrated visual understanding.
- GPT-4V can understand rendered web pages and generate textual plans for tasks.
- Grounding textual plans into precise actions on websites remains challenging.
- HTML code is noisier and less information-dense than rendered visuals.
- SECT outperforms existing methods in completing tasks on different websites.
- The best grounding strategy leverages both HTML text and visuals.
- In-context learning with large models shows better generalization to unseen websites.
- Online evaluation is more indicative of a model's true performance than offline evaluation.
- Action generation involves producing an action description at each step.
- Action grounding converts textual descriptions into executable actions on websites.
- Three grounding approaches: element attributes, textual choices, and image annotation.
- Oracle grounding ensures variables can be identified from the action description.
- Experiments conducted on the m2web dataset with over 2,000 complex web tasks.
- GPT-4V shows potential as a versatile web agent with effective action grounding.
- Grounding via textual choice shows the best performance across all settings.
- Fine-tuned models may not be optimal for webpage screenshots.
- ICL methods offer a compelling solution for generalist web agents.
- Online evaluation suggests offline evaluation underestimates performance due to action variability.
- Error analysis reveals challenges in grounding via image annotation.
- GPT-4V demonstrates long-range action planning and error correction capabilities.
- Web agents aim to achieve seamless human-web interaction through natural language commands.
- Visual markers enhance LMMs' ability to understand intricate image details.
- Safety concerns include privacy issues and potential harmful actions by web agents.
