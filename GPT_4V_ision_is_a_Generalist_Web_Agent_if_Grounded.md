# SUMMARY
The paper explores large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V and their potential as generalist web agents. It introduces SECT, a web agent leveraging LMMs for visual understanding and action generation on websites.

# IDEAS:
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V excel in vision and language tasks.
- Websites present a unique challenge and opportunity for LMMs.
- Screenshots of websites contain thousands of elements with intricate relationships.
- HTML code is noisier and less information-dense than rendered visuals.
- SECT leverages LMMs for integrated visual understanding and action on the web.
- GPT-4V can visually understand rendered web pages and generate textual plans.
- Grounding textual plans into precise actions on websites remains challenging.
- Superimposing bounding boxes and index labels onto images aids grounding.
- Known correspondence between HTML elements and visual rendering aids grounding.
- SECT outperforms existing methods in completing tasks on different websites.
- Oracle grounding significantly improves SECT's task completion success rate.
- Grounding via element attributes, textual choices, and image annotation are explored.
- In-context learning shows better generalization to unseen websites.
- Supervised fine-tuning has an edge on websites seen during training.
- Online evaluation is more indicative of a model's true performance.
- Action generation involves producing an action description at each step.
- Action grounding converts textual descriptions into executable actions.
- Three grounding approaches: element attributes, textual choices, image annotation.
- M2Web dataset includes over 2,000 complex web tasks across various domains.
- Evaluation metrics include element accuracy, operation F1, step success rate, success rate.
- Online evaluation tool converts predicted actions into browser events on live websites.
- GPT-4V shows promise in long-range action planning and error correction.
- Web agents aim to achieve seamless human-web interaction.
- Visual markers enhance GPT-4V's ability to understand intricate image details.
- Web agents could significantly improve web accessibility for non-tech-savvy users.
- Safety concerns include privacy issues and potential harmful actions by web agents.

# INSIGHTS:
