# SUMMARY
The paper explores large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V and their potential as generalist web agents. It introduces SECT, a web agent leveraging LMMs for visual understanding and action generation on websites.

# IDEAS:
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V excel in vision and language tasks.
- Websites present a unique challenge for LMMs due to their complex visual design.
- SECT is proposed as a generalist web agent using LMMs for integrated visual understanding.
- GPT-4V can understand rendered web pages and generate textual plans.
- Grounding textual plans into precise actions on websites remains challenging.
- HTML code is noisier and less information-dense than rendered visuals.
- SECT outperforms existing methods in completing tasks on different websites.
- The best grounding strategy leverages both HTML text and visuals.
- In-context learning with large models shows better generalization to unseen websites.
- Online evaluation is more indicative of a model's true performance than offline evaluation.
- Action generation involves producing an action description at each step.
- Action grounding converts textual descriptions into executable actions on websites.
- Three grounding approaches: element attributes, textual choices, and image annotation.
- The m2web dataset includes over 2,000 complex web tasks across various domains.
- GPT-4V shows potential as a versatile web agent with effective action grounding.
- Oracle grounding significantly outperforms other models in all metrics.
- Element grounding via textual choice shows the best performance among proposed methods.
- Fine-tuned models may not be optimal for webpage screenshots.
- ICL methods offer a compelling solution for generalist web agents.
- Online evaluation suggests offline evaluation underestimates performance due to action variability.
- GPT-4V demonstrates long-range action planning and error correction capabilities.

# INSIGHTS:
- LMMs like GPT-4V can transform web interaction by understanding and acting on complex webpages.
- Effective grounding methods are crucial for converting textual plans into precise web actions.
- Combining HTML text and visuals enhances grounding accuracy for web agents.

- Online evaluations provide a more accurate measure of a model's real-world performance.
- Web agents must handle diverse tasks requiring multiple actions across dynamic web pages.
- Oracle grounding highlights the potential of LMMs but also the challenges in practical applications.
- Textual choice grounding offers a balance between accuracy and practicality for web agents.
- Fine-tuning models on specific tasks can improve performance but may limit generalization.
- Safety and ethical considerations are paramount in deploying web agents for real-world use.
