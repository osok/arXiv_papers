# SUMMARY
The section explores latent diffusion models (LDMs) and their efficiency in tasks like image synthesis, comparing them to non-diffusion models.

# IDEAS:
- Latent diffusion models (LDMs) show potential in image synthesis, video creation, audio production, and 3D synthesis.
- A major challenge with LDMs is their low sampling efficiency due to multi-step sampling requirements.
- Methods like 50-step DD sampling ensure high-quality outputs but can be slow, especially on mobile devices.
- Single-shot generative models like GANs don't require iterative refinement, unlike LDMs.
- Recent advancements focus on faster network architectures and improved sampling algorithms to reduce inference time.
- Diffusion distillation simplifies the process by learning multi-step sampling results in a single pass.
- Smaller LDMs may outperform larger ones under the same sampling budget.
- The size of pre-trained LDMs impacts sampling efficiency in tasks like super-resolution and text-to-image synthesis.
- Pre-training performance scales with training compute; downstream performance scales with pre-training quality.
- Smaller models sample more efficiently initially, but larger models excel in detail generation with relaxed computational constraints.
- Diffusion distillation does not fundamentally alter scaling trends.
- Smaller models consistently demonstrate superior sampling efficiency across various diffusion samplers and downstream tasks.
- Increasing the size of diffusion models can enhance their generative performance but may be impractical for common inference budgets.
- Non-diffusion generative models like VAEs and GANs are more efficient as they do not rely heavily on iterative refinement.
- Scaling up non-diffusion models like StyleGAN and Mask Transformer models has been successful for tasks like text-to-image generation.
- Larger LDMs outperformed smaller ones in recovering fine details after pre-training and fine-tuning.
- Pre-training performance had a greater impact on super-resolution results than the duration of fine-tuning.
- Larger models achieve superior results even with short fine-tuning periods.
- Non-diffusion generative models require fewer sampling steps but more parameters compared to diffusion models.
- CFG rate directly impacts the balance between visual quality and alignment with text prompts.
- Changes in CFG rates have a more significant effect on visual quality than on prompt semantic accuracy.
- Smaller models often outperform larger models in terms of FID scores across various sampling costs.
- Smaller models can match the performance of larger models under similar sampling cost conditions.
- Scaling properties of LDMs remain consistent regardless of the diffusion sampler used.
- Smaller models exhibit higher sampling efficiency when the number of sampling steps is limited.
- Larger models demonstrate greater efficiency beyond a certain threshold of sampling steps.
- Scaled models maintain consistent efficiency on fewer sampling steps across tasks.
- Smaller undistilled models can perform similarly to larger distilled models at specific sampling costs.
