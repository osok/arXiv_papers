# SUMMARY
The section introduces Recurrent Gemma2B, a model based on the Griffin architecture, highlighting its efficiency in processing long sequences and reduced memory usage.

# IDEAS:
- Recurrent Gemma2B uses linear recurrences and local attention instead of global attention.
- Unlike Transformers, Recurrent Gemma2B compresses input sequences into a fixed-size state.
- This compression reduces memory usage and allows efficient processing of long sequences.
- Recurrent Gemma2B shows significantly faster inference compared to Gemma2B.
- Pre-trained and instruction-tuned checkpoints are provided along with JAX code for evaluation.
- A specialized Palace kernel for linear recurrence on TPUs is included.
- A PyTorch implementation is also available for Recurrent Gemma2B.
- Input embeddings are multiplied by a constant equal to the square root of the model width.
- The input and output embeddings are tied, but the factor is not applied to the output.
- Key hyperparameters are defined in a table, with no weight decay for recurrent layers.
- Derivatives are clipped during backpropagation through the square root operation for stability.
- Pre-training is done on sequences of 8,192 tokens using English data from various sources.
- Recurrent Gemma2B is pre-trained on 2T tokens, similar to Gemma's approach.
- A subset of the SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 256k tokens is used.
- Instruction tuning involves a novel RHF algorithm for specific dialogue formats.
- Recurrent Gemma2B performs well across different domains, matching Gemma2B's performance.
- Human evaluations show competitive win rates against Mistol 7Bv0.2 Instruct model.
- Smaller state size on long sequences allows efficient generation without increasing memory requirements.
- Throughput benchmarks demonstrate higher efficiency in processing long sequences.
- Figures illustrate higher throughput achieved by Recurrent Gemma at various sequence lengths.
- Safety measures from the Gemma release are implemented in Recurrent Gemma2B.
- Models are tested on common safety benchmarks and assessed by an external team.
- Users are advised to perform their own safety assessments tailored to their specific needs.

# INSIGHTS:
