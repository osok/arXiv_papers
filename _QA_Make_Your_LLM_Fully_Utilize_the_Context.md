# SUMMARY
The proposed In2 Training method aims to solve the "lost in the middle" challenge in long context large language models (LLMs) by teaching models to utilize information throughout the entire context.

# IDEAS:
- The "lost in the middle" challenge refers to LLMs overlooking middle context information.
- In2 Training teaches models that crucial information can be present throughout the entire context.
- Traditional training methods may unintentionally bias models to focus on context extremities.
- A synthesized long context question-answer dataset is used for training.
- The dataset includes fine-grained information awareness and multi-segment reasoning questions.
- The dataset length ranges from 4K to 32K tokens to prevent bias.
- Short context question-answer pairs are retained to avoid forgetting short context capabilities.
- The training process involves fine-tuning the model using instruction tuning.
- Long contexts and questions serve as instructions during training.
- The training uses a global batch size of 128 and a cosine learning rate decay strategy.
- Training is conducted over 300 GPU days with around 14K steps.
- In2 Training improves long context information awareness and utilization.
- Probing results show In2 Training mitigates the "lost in the middle" problem.
- Synthesized data generalizes well to real-world scenarios, improving performance on various tasks.
- In2 Training maintains performance on short context tasks, ensuring model versatility.
- Open-source models like FILM 7B can achieve comparable performance to proprietary models like GPT-4 Turbo.
- V-probing tasks include document, code, and structured data context styles.
- FILM 7B shows robust performance across different positions within the whole context.
- FILM 7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models of similar size.
- Limitations include potential bias from synthesized data and reliance on a specific training paradigm.
- Overfitting on synthesized data may lead to underperformance in real-world variability.
- Instruction tuning may not be feasible or optimal for all applications or scenarios.
