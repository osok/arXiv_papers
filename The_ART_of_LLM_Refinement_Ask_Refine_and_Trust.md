# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss the limitations of self-refinement in large language models (LLMs) and propose a new approach called ART (Ask, Refine, Trust) to improve performance and cost-effectiveness.

# IDEAS:
- Self-refinement often worsens initial outputs in multi-step reasoning tasks.
- Fine-tuning LLMs usually enhances performance by aligning with task objectives.
- Training smaller models on LLM data can be a cost-effective alternative.
- ART involves three stages: Ask, Refine, and Trust.
- Smaller models trained to decide when to refine can outperform larger models.
- ART proved cost-effective compared to fine-tuning LLMs.
- Asker and Truster models work seamlessly with various LLMs.
- Chain of Thought and sub-question decomposition are effective strategies.
- ART trains smaller models to verify reasoning rather than teaching them to reason.
- Initial predictions are generated using Chain of Thought or sub-question decomposition.
- Asker model decides if a prediction needs refinement.
- Truster model chooses between the original and refined output.
- ART was tested on GSM 8K and Strategy QA tasks.
- Fine-tuning Llama models created effective Asker and Truster models.
- Combining refinement with the trust module consistently improved performance.
- Training an Asker model significantly improved performance over self-refinement.
- Trust module helps determine if refinement improves or worsens predictions.
- Training a Truster model is cheaper than fine-tuning larger models.
- Always refining can lead to worse results; balance is key.
- Asking questions leads to better refinement decisions.
- ART methodology can be extended to state-of-the-art models.
- Superior mathematical reasoning helps evaluate predictions more effectively.
- Generating the entire sequence is more challenging than individual components.
- Smaller models trained for refinement decisions save computation costs.
- Expert models make better judgments about refinement.
