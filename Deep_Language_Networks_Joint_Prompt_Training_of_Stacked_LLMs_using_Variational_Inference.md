# SUMMARY
The paper discusses a modular approach to building large language models (LLMs) by viewing them as layers in a deep language network (DLN). It explores optimizing prompts and training multi-layer networks to improve performance on various tasks.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs have grown substantially, bringing technical and societal challenges.
- Research focuses on smaller models matching larger ones via distillation.
- Modular systems view LLMs as language layers within a deep language network (DLN).
- Each DLN layer receives input from the previous layer's output.
- Templates structure conditioning information into strings before invoking the LLM.
- Tasks are broken into smaller subtasks manageable for an LLM.
- Learnable components are integrated into the pipeline, optimizing overall performance.
- Prompts are optimized in a shallow one-layer language network (DLN1).
- DLN1 sets up a distribution dependent on inputs, outputs, and a learnable prompt.
- Prompts verbalize complex examples, enhancing performance.
- Two-layer deep language networks (DLN2) set up a probability distribution dependent on inputs and learnable prompts.
- Variational inference algorithm optimizes the overall log likelihood.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) and self-consistency (SC) methods are incorporated.
- DLNs generalize by learning task-specific prior distributions over successful CoTs.
- One-layer LLMs are complete function classes indexed by prompts.
- Prompt engineering and in-context learning (ICL) optimize LLMs at the prompt level.
- Language layers transform strings X into Y, modulated by another string Pi.
- Templates describe how X and Pi are combined before being fed to the LLM operator.
- Automatic prompt engineering (APE) optimizes prompt selection using local search methods.
- Prompt proposal distribution conditions on input batch, output, and current prompt.
- Scoring function selects the improved prompt maximizing data log likelihood.
- Two-layer DLNs use hidden variables to explain target outputs.
- Variational inference learns prompts by estimating the marginal log likelihood of Y given X.
- Posterior sharpening improves the accuracy of the approximate posterior distribution.
- Experiments show DLN1 outperforms some advanced LLMs on specific tasks.
- DLN2 improves performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning.
- Prompt-based learning has evolved with dynamic and iterative techniques.
- Augmented LLMs utilize external resources like API calls and search engines.
- Multi-layer LLM systems treat LLMs as nodes in a computational graph.
