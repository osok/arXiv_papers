# IDEAS:
- Transferable learning in classical machine learning domains includes visual recognition and language understanding.
- Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced self-supervised learning.
- Auto-regressive language modeling through next-token prediction is a successful self-supervised learning approach.
- This method scales well with web-scale text data and model size.
- Training experiments on smaller scales can predict properties of larger-scale models.
- LLMs like GPT-3/4 excel in few-shot and zero-shot tasks.
- LLMs demonstrate emergent functions like in-context learning.
- Some studies question the generalization and reasoning abilities of LLMs.
- Simple prompt adjustments can address many LLM failures.
- A fictional character problem (Alice) was used to test LLM reasoning.
- Most state-of-the-art LLMs struggled with the Alice problem.
- New benchmarks are needed to assess LLM reasoning capabilities accurately.
- Tasks designed for 7 to 10-year-olds were used to challenge LLMs.
- The AIW problem involves determining how many sisters Alice's brother has.
- Most models relied on basic arithmetic instead of logical reasoning.
- Prompt engineering significantly affects model responses.
- Standard, thinking, and restricted prompts influence model behavior differently.
- Models' responses varied based on prompt type used.
- Evaluating model responses using a beta-binomial distribution estimates correct response rates.
- Larger models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus performed better on reasoning tasks.
- Smaller models often failed despite high benchmark scores.
- There is a discrepancy between benchmark scores and actual reasoning abilities.
- AIW plus problem formulation proved even more challenging for models.
- Models exhibited overconfidence in incorrect solutions, termed confabulations.
- Models struggled with relational SQL database formats and parameterized problems.
- Multi-turn interactions and customized prompts did not significantly improve model performance.
- New benchmarks like Helm or Big Bench aim to evaluate generalization capabilities beyond memorization.
