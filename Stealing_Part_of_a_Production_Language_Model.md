# SUMMARY
The text discusses a novel attack method to extract the final embedding projection layer of blackbox transformer language models, revealing crucial model parameters and raising security concerns.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models like GPT-4 and Gemini are secretive due to competitive and security concerns.
- Model stealing involves extracting model weights by querying the model's API.
- The attack introduced can recover the complete embedding projection layer of a transformer language model.
- Unlike previous methods, this attack works top-down, directly extracting the model's final layer.
- Exploiting the low-rank nature of the final layer helps extract crucial information like model width and hidden dimensions.
- Stealing the final layer provides insights into the model structure and aids future attacks.
- The attack has been successfully applied to models like Google's Palm 2 and OpenAI's GPT-4.
- High-fidelity attacks aim to create stolen models that closely match the target model's performance.
- Previous attacks focused on specific properties of deep neural networks but were not scalable to production language models.
- The new attack is effective and efficient in extracting crucial information from blackbox models.
- The threat model assumes adversaries lack extra knowledge about model parameters.
- The logit API serves as a baseline threat model for developing attack methods.
- The attack determines the hidden dimension H using the logit API and recovers the matrix W.
- By querying the model with various random prefixes, linear dependencies among queries can be identified.
- The rank of the query response matrix equals the hidden dimension H.
- Practical considerations for numerical precision in computing the rank of the matrix are provided.
- The attack successfully identifies the embedding size with minimal errors across various models.
- The final output projection matrix W connects the last hidden layer to the output logits.
- Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to retrieve an approximation of W in the logit API threat model.
- Efficient attack strategies are introduced based on token cost and query cost.
- Logit bias APIs offer log probabilities for top K tokens, aiding in efficient information extraction.
- Improved cost-optimal attacks generalize the approach to minimize both query and token costs.
- Multi-token queries and examining log probabilities for each prefix reduce costs.
- Log prob-free attacks reconstruct the complete logit vector using binary search on the logit bias vector.
- Adjusting logit bias for multiple tokens simultaneously enhances attack efficiency.
- Balancing sampling of all output tokens leads to more efficient and precise attacks.
- Defenses include removing logit bias parameters, architectural changes, and rate limits on queries.
