# SUMMARY
The paper addresses the lack of instruction hierarchy in large language models (LLMs), proposing a method to prioritize system messages over user and third-party content to improve robustness and safety against attacks.

# IDEAS:
- Lack of instruction hierarchy in LLMs allows adversaries to override higher-level instructions.
- Proposed method instills a hierarchy where system messages take precedence over user messages.
- Training involves synthetic data generation and context distillation for aligned and misaligned instructions.
- Models are trained to ignore lower-level instructions if they conflict with higher-level ones.
- Evaluations show improved robustness and generalization to held-out attacks.
- Instruction hierarchy increases safety against prompt injections and jailbreaks.
- The method prevents over-refusal behavior, ensuring models don't ignore benign queries.
- Theoretical benefits include preventing catastrophic harms from various attacks.
- Practical benefits include systematic handling of message conflicts in LLMs.
- Improved robustness by 63% against system prompt extraction and 30% against jailbreaks.
- Generalization to unseen attacks showcases the adaptability of the approach.
- Instruction hierarchy does not degrade generic capabilities of the models.
- Enhanced controllability and safety in real-world applications.
- Trust and usability of LLMs are significantly enhanced.
- Fine-tuning involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
- Evaluation suite included open-source and novel datasets for various attack scenarios.
- Error bars reported for each evaluation, with higher values indicating better performance.
- Over-refusal results aim to match baseline performance on non-conflicting instructions.
- Main results showed significant improvements in safety across all evaluations.
- Comparable performance to baseline on capability evaluations like trivia QA and LoMaDa.
- Addressing over-refusal behavior is crucial for model performance in certain tasks.
- Further data collection needed to fine-tune decision-making regarding instructions.
