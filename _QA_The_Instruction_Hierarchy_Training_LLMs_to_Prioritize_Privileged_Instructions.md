# SUMMARY
The paper addresses the lack of instruction hierarchy in large language models (LLMs), proposing a method to prioritize system messages over user and third-party content to improve robustness and safety against attacks.

# IDEAS:
- Lack of instruction hierarchy in LLMs allows adversaries to override higher-level instructions.
- Proposed method instills a hierarchy where system messages take precedence over user messages.
- Training involves synthetic data generation and context distillation for aligned and misaligned instructions.
- Models are trained to ignore lower-level instructions if they conflict with higher-level ones.
- Evaluations show improved robustness and generalization to held-out attacks.
- Instruction hierarchy prevents prompt injections, jailbreaks, and system message extractions.
- Hierarchy ensures system messages from developers take precedence over user or third-party content.
- Improved robustness by 63% against system prompt extraction and 30% against jailbreaks.
- Generalization to attacks not directly modeled during training showcases adaptability.
- Instruction hierarchy does not degrade generic capabilities of the models.
- Provides a systematic way to handle conflicts between different types of messages in LLMs.
- Enhances controllability and safety of LLMs in real-world applications.
- Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
- Evaluation suite included open-source and novel datasets covering in-domain attacks.
- Error bars reported for each evaluation with higher values indicating better performance.
- Over-refusal behavior observed where models may ignore benign queries unnecessarily.
- Further data collection needed to address over-refusal behavior.
- Instruction hierarchy leads to improved safety, generalization, and strong performance on capability evaluations.
- Models validated using various safety and capability benchmarks.
- Best performing checkpoint used for evaluation across various benchmarks.
- Instruction hierarchy increases robustness by up to 63% in main evaluations.
- Generalization to excluded evaluation criteria such as jailbreaks and prompt injections via tool use.
- Over-refusal results aim to prevent models from always ignoring lower priority instructions.
- Models tested across various scenarios to ensure internalization of instruction hierarchy.
