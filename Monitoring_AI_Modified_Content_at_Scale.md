# SUMMARY
The text discusses the challenges of distinguishing AI-generated text from human-written content and introduces a new method, distributional GPT quantification, to monitor AI-modified content in information ecosystems.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in education, science, and media sectors.
- Differentiating between AI-generated text and human-written content is increasingly difficult.
- Misleading AI-generated text can be mistaken for reliable information, posing significant risks.
- AI-generated content like medical abstracts and news articles can deceive readers and detectors.
- LLMs can unintentionally amplify biases, affecting hiring decisions and cultural representations.
- Analyzing LLM output collectively reveals trends not apparent in individual instances.
- Distributional GPT quantification estimates the proportion of AI-generated content in datasets.
- This method is more computationally efficient than existing AI text detection methods.
- The method uses historical data and maximum likelihood estimation for accurate results.
- Experiments show distinct patterns in AI-generated texts compared to human-written reviews.
- A notable presence of AI-generated content was found in conference reviews post-ChatGPT.
- Zero-shot LLM detection identifies text created by language models without direct model access.
- Training-based detection fine-tunes models on datasets containing both human and AI-generated text.
- LLM watermarking embeds detectable signals directly into text for identification purposes.
- The proposed method estimates AI-generated text proportion without classifying individual documents.
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) determines the fraction of AI-generated documents.
- The method uses historical data to estimate token usage distributions for human and AI texts.
- The approach is validated on synthetic target corpora with known proportions of AI-generated documents.
- The method significantly reduces estimation errors and computational costs compared to existing methods.
- Peer reviews showed a notable increase in AI-generated sentences post-ChatGPT introduction.
- Reviews with scholarly citations showed lower levels of LLM usage, indicating struggles with academic references.
- Reviews submitted shortly before deadlines showed increased LLM usage.
- LLM-generated text may lead to standardization of feedback, limiting diversity of ideas in peer reviews.
- Negative correlation between reviewer confidence and ChatGPT usage was observed.
- Generated texts tend to offer less specific feedback or references to other works.
- Corpora containing AI-generated text exhibit reduced linguistic variation and epistemic diversity.
- Concerns about privacy risks associated with sharing unpublished work with privately owned language models.
- Similar results can be obtained using alternative LLMs like GPT 3.5.
