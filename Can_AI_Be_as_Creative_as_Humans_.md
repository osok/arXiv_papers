# SUMMARY
The authors discuss the importance of creativity in humans and AI, proposing a framework called relative creativity to evaluate AI's creative outputs compared to human creators. They introduce statistical creativity for empirical validation and explore autoregressive models and prompt-conditioned large language models (LLMs) within this framework.

# IDEAS:
- Creativity drives societal transformation and progress in science, technology, and the arts.
- AI models powered by deep learning show impressive abilities in solving complex problems.
- AI has demonstrated artistic flair, composing poetry and crafting stories.
- AI models have outperformed MBA students in innovative product and service concepts.
- Defining creativity is challenging due to its subjective nature.
- Novelty and quality criteria for creativity vary across cultures, disciplines, and time periods.
- AI models generate outputs that mirror their training data, raising originality questions.
- Establishing an objective framework for evaluating AI's creativity is crucial.
- Relative creativity compares AI outputs to those of human creators.
- Statistical creativity allows empirical validation of relative creativity.
- Autoregressive models excel in predicting and generating the next token within a prompting paradigm.
- Statistical creative loss fosters statistical creativity during model training.
- Quantity of creator-creation pairs is crucial for developing statistically creative models.
- Relative creativity is similar to the Turing Test's method of evaluating intelligence.
- AI might seem more creative compared to non-experts but less so compared to experts.
- Statistical creativity measures how similar AI outputs are to human creators' works.
- Prompting setup incorporates user and system prompts into the creativity framework.
- Generalization in deep learning is crucial for achieving statistical creativity.
- Overfitting is a potential issue in training models for statistical creativity.
- Previous definitions of creativity highlight its multifaceted nature.
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs) create unique artistic styles by maximizing differences from known styles.
- Text style transfer (TST) changes the style of a given text to match a target style.
- Controllable text generation meets constraints like politeness, sentiment, or stylistic requirements.
- Theoretical foundation for creativity includes insights on diversity and quality of generation.
