# SUMMARY
The authors discuss the importance of creativity in humans and AI, proposing a framework called relative creativity to evaluate AI's creative outputs compared to human creators. They introduce statistical creativity for empirical validation and explore autoregressive models and prompt-conditioned large language models (LLMs) within this framework.

- AI models powered by deep learning have shown impressive abilities in solving complex problems.
- AI models have demonstrated artistic flair, composing poetry and crafting stories.
- AI models have outperformed MBA students in the quality and uniqueness of innovative product concepts.
- The evolving creative abilities of AI raise questions about the nature of creativity.
- There is no consensus on what exactly constitutes human creativity due to its subjective nature.
- The originality of AI creations is questioned as they mirror their training data.
- Establishing an objective framework for evaluating AI's creativity is crucial.
- The concept of relative creativity compares AI outputs to those of human creators.
- Statistical creativity allows for empirical validation by comparing AI outputs to existing human creative outputs.
- Autoregressive models are key components of large language models (LLMs).
- Statistical creativity in AI involves comparing next token predictions with human creators' works.
- Prompting setups enhance the framework for evaluating statistical creativity in LLMs.
- Statistical creative loss is introduced as a method for training creative AI models.
- Generalization in deep learning is crucial for achieving statistical creativity.
- Overfitting in models can be addressed by incorporating future advancements in generalization research.
- Previous definitions of creativity highlight its multifaceted nature.
- The four Ps framework (person, press, process, product) is commonly used to assess creativity.
- Combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational are three nuanced forms of creativity.
- Relative creativity avoids the question of absolute creativity by focusing on parallel universes of humans and AI.
- Image generation models have sparked curiosity about machine-generated artistic creations.
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs) create unique artistic styles by maximizing differences from known styles.
- Language models are being optimized to understand subtleties in human communication.
- Controllable text generation ensures outputs meet constraints like politeness or sentiment.
- Text style transfer (TST) changes the style of a given text to match a target style.
- Previous applications focus on predefined tasks as proxies for creativity rather than defining it directly.
