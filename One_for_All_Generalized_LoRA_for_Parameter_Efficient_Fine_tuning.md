# SUMMARY
The text discusses the challenges of fine-tuning large pre-trained models on diverse downstream datasets and proposes a flexible, parameter-efficient fine-tuning scheme called Generalized LoRA (GLoRA). GLoRA enhances the low-rank adaptation approach with a more generalized prompt module design per layer, outperforming previous methods on various benchmarks, including downstream fine-tuning, few-shot learning, and domain generalization and robustness, while requiring only a small number of extra parameters and no additional inference cost.
