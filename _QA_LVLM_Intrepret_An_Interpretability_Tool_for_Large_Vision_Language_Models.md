# IDEAS:
- LVM Interpret addresses hallucination in LVMs by providing interpretability tools for interactive analysis.
- The goal is to understand the reasoning behind model responses, especially in visual contexts.
- LVM Interpret adapts multiple interpretability methods like raw attention, relevancy maps, and causal interpretation.
- Hallucination refers to the fabrication of untrue information by large language models.
- LVMs like GPT and LLC can generate false information despite their understanding capabilities.
- Hallucination is a significant challenge in LVMs, exacerbated by visual information.
- Interpreting and explaining model outputs to mitigate hallucination is a growing challenge.
- LVM Interpret provides raw attention visualization, relevancy maps, and causal interpretation.
- Raw attention visualization helps identify potential areas of hallucination.
- Relevancy maps assign local relevancy scores to input elements based on their contribution to the output.
- Causal interpretation helps derive causal explanations from attention in neural networks.
- LVM Interpret employs CLE Ann for causal interpretation in LVMs.
- Users can visualize average attentions between image patches and tokens.
- Relevancy maps illustrate the relevance of different input components to the model's output.
- Causal interpretation identifies specific input tokens influencing output tokens.
- Interactive visualization of raw attentions helps understand global behavior within LVMs.
- Relevancy maps aid in model debugging and providing explanations for inaccuracies.
- Causal interpretation enhances trust and confidence in model predictions.
- Users can manipulate input tokens to observe changes in model output.
- LVM Interpret uses Gradio for its user interface and functionality.
