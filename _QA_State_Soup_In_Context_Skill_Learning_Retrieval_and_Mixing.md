- States corresponding to the same task are grouped together in proper clustering.
- The model can reliably identify the correct task even with low k-shot examples.
- Mixing states can enhance few-shot performance by using a task library.
- Mixtures of states can perform as well as or better than processing the entire 32-shot at once.

- AD Decay mixing involves a linear combination of the previous state and current input.
- AD Decay mixing allows independent processing of subsequences and then combining them.
- AD Decay mixing outperforms mean mixing and starting from a state that only processed one chunk.
