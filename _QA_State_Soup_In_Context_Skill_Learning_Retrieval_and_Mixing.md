# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the drawbacks of Transformer architecture, introduces state soups for enhancing training objectives, and explores task retrieval and state mixing to improve model performance.

# IDEAS:
- Transformer architecture's memory and computational costs scale quadratically with context length.
- Recurrent models' inference costs scale linearly with context length.
- State soups involve building a library of in-context learned skills represented by RNN states.
- Model soups linearly interpolate parameters of several models to improve training objectives.
- State soups enable parallel information processing across independent models.
- State soups cache pre-processed information for later retrieval.
- Task retrieval involves building a library of in-context learned skills for retrieval and mixing.
- Skills are generated using a pre-trained Mamba model with two 8B parameters.
- Each skill state is derived from processing 32 examples from multiple disjoint sets.
- Task retrieval aims to retrieve the corresponding state from the skill set given a short task example.
- State mixing enhances model performance by combining different states.
- State mixing with sequential data applies mixing to ordered sequences.
- Intermediate layers from every state in the skill library are projected to two dimensions using t-SNE.
- The model can reliably identify the correct task even with low k-shot examples.
- Mixing states can enhance few-shot performance by using a task library.
- Mixtures of states can perform as well as or better than processing the entire 32-shot at once.
- Incorporating states retrieved from a state library boosts model performance with small k values.
- AD Decay mixing considers the sequential nature of data for processing long sequences.
- AD Decay mixing uses a single discretized state space model (SSM) layer for recursive processing.
- AD Decay mixing outperforms mean mixing and starting from a state that processed part of the sequence.
- Mixing states from distinct tasks leverages knowledge learned from one task to improve another.
- Cross-task knowledge transfer showcases potential for creating versatile and adaptable models.
- Findings highlight potential for enhancing model performance through task-specific state mixing.

# INSIGHTS:
