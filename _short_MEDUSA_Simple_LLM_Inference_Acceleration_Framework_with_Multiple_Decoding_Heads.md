- Rescaling between activations and parameters eliminates outliers and simplifies quantization.
- Matrix multiplications are primarily broken down into 8-bit operations with some 16-bit operations.
- Iterative rounding of weight columns into 3/4 of a bit compresses large language models.
- Activation-aware quantization scheme compresses large language models to 3/4 of a bit.
- Sparse plus low precision pattern handles a minor portion of vital weights.
