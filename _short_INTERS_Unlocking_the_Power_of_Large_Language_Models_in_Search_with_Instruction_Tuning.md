# SUMMARY
The paper explores various query processing and information retrieval tasks using multiple data sets, including query description, expansion, reformulation, intent classification, and more.

# IDEAS:
- Query description aims to describe documents relevant to a user-provided query using specific data sets.
- Query expansion elaborates an original query into a more detailed version while preserving search intent.
- Query reformulation enhances user input queries to make them more explicit and comprehensible for search engines.
- Query intent classification discerns the type of intent behind a query, such as informational, transactional, or navigational.
- Query clarification addresses unclear or ambiguous user queries by asking for further details or providing clarification options.
- Query matching determines if two queries or texts convey the same meaning using the MSRP data set.
- Query subtopic generation identifies and presents various aspects of the initial query to aid search engines.
- Query suggestion predicts the next likely query based on user queries and search behaviors using the AOL data set.
- Fact verification assesses whether a claim is supported or refuted by given evidence.
- Summarization creates a concise summary of lengthy documents while accurately reflecting their content.
- Reading comprehension generates an answer to a question using information from a given context.
- Conversational question answering responds to a series of interrelated questions based on a given context.
- Document reranking ranks a list of candidate documents according to their relevance to the user's query.
- Data sets used include gov 2, TRC robust, fire query 2 DOC, TC web 0914, MSRP, AOL, Squad, Ms Marco, and web GM QA.
- The research aims to enhance the search experience by improving various aspects of query processing.
- Query description uses data sets like gov 2 TC robust and fire8 10 to 12.
- Query expansion uses data sets like gov 2 TRC robust fire query 2 DOC and TC web 0914.
- Query reformulation uses data sets like gov 2 TRC robust fire query 2 DOC and TC web 0914.
- Query intent classification uses data sets like gov 2 TRC robust fire query 2 DOC and TC web 0914.
- Query clarification uses data sets like gov 2 TRC robust fire query 2 DOC and TC web 0914.
- Query matching uses the MSRP data set to determine if two queries convey the same meaning.
- Query subtopic generation uses the TRC web 0914 data set to identify various aspects of the initial query.
- Query suggestion uses the AOL data set to predict the next likely query based on user behavior.
- Fact verification assesses claims using evidence from various data sets.
- Summarization creates concise summaries of lengthy documents using various data sets.
- Reading comprehension uses data sets like Squad Ms Marco and web GM QA to generate answers from context.
- Conversational question answering uses data sets like Squad Ms Marco and web GM QA to respond to interrelated questions.
- Document reranking uses data sets like Ms Marco passage reranking data set touche 2020 Kora.
