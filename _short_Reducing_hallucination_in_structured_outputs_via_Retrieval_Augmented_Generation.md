# SUMMARY
The paper discusses enhancing alignment between natural language and JSON objects for workflow generation using retriever encoders, Siamese Transformer encoders, and retrieval-augmented generation.

# IDEAS:
- Training a retriever encoder improves mapping between text and JSON objects.
- Fine-tuning a retriever model achieves better application domain representation.
- Using a Siamese Transformer encoder with mean pooling encodes user queries and JSON objects.
- Training a language model (LLM) in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) fashion.
- Incorporating the retriever's output in the LLM's prompt enhances structured output tasks.
- Training the retriever and LLM separately simplifies the process.
- Augmenting the dataset with suggested step and table names from the retriever.
- Inserting the retriever's output in JSON format into the LLM input.
- Ensuring resulting embeddings have a norm of one using mean pooling.
- Generating embeddings for user queries, steps, and tables.
- Training the retriever model on pairs of user queries and corresponding steps or tables.
- Using contrastive loss to construct positive and negative training pairs.
- Improving retriever training based on cosine similarity.
- Building an index of steps and tables during initialization using FIS.
- Enabling efficient retrieval of steps and tables based on user queries.
- Embedding incoming queries using the retriever.
- Retrieving top-k steps and tables based on cosine similarity for workflow generation.
- Augmenting the dataset with suggested step and table names from the retriever for LLM training.
- Proceeding with standard LLM supervised fine-tuning.
- Simplifying the structured output task for the LLM through retriever's output incorporation.

# INSIGHTS:
