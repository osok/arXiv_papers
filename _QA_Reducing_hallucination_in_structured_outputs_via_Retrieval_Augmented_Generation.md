# SUMMARY
The paper addresses hallucination in using large language models (LLMs) for workflow generation, proposing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy and trustworthiness.

# IDEAS:
- Hallucination refers to generating non-existent steps or tables in workflows.
- Hallucination is a significant concern in structured output tasks like converting natural language to workflows.
- Naive use of LLMs can result in hallucinations, especially with out-of-distribution inputs.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces hallucination by incorporating relevant information before generating text.
- RAG involves training a retriever encoder to align natural language with JSON objects.
- The retriever maps natural language to existing step and database table names.
- An index of steps and tables is built using FAISS during initialization.
- The retriever suggests steps and tables based on the natural language query.
- The LLM generates the workflow in JSON format via greedy decoding.
- RAG helps in decreasing the generation of false or non-existent information.
- Incorporating RAG enhances the quality of the generated workflows.
- RAG improves trustworthiness by providing plausible JSON objects before generation.
- RAG facilitates customization of workflows by allowing users to specify requirements in natural language.
- RAG enables the deployment of smaller LLMs while maintaining performance quality.
- RAG makes structured output tasks more accessible to users without specialized knowledge.
- Training a retriever model enhances the mapping between text and structured data.
- RAG supports generating valid and executable workflows even in complex settings.
- RAG aids in generating valid structured outputs from natural language queries.
- Fine-tuning the RAG models significantly reduces hallucination in generated workflows.
- Larger LLMs can better copy and paste retrieved steps and tables during generation.
- Fine-tuning smaller LLMs with the retriever's output improves performance.
- The 7B version of the RAG fine-tuned model provides the best trade-off between performance and model size.
- Pre-training on large amounts of natural language data may be detrimental to specific tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
- Hallucination in LLMs can lead to unreliable and untrustworthy workflow outputs.
- RAG reduces hallucination by aligning natural language with existing JSON objects.
- Fine-tuning smaller LLMs with retriever outputs improves workflow generation accuracy.
- RAG enhances trustworthiness by ensuring generated JSON properties are valid and executable.
- Customization of workflows is facilitated by allowing natural language specifications.
- Smaller LLMs can maintain performance quality with RAG, reducing infrastructure costs.
- Structured output tasks become more accessible with RAG, lowering barriers for users.
- Training a retriever model improves text-to-structured data mapping, enhancing system effectiveness.
- Fine-tuning significantly reduces hallucination, improving overall system performance.
- Optimal performance is achieved through fine-tuning smaller LLMs rather than relying on larger models.
