# SUMMARY
Researchers explore aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences using methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLF). They compare reward-based and reward-free approaches, finding Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) superior to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in various tasks.
