- Deep learning has shown remarkable progress by learning from vast data sets in various fields.
- Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face challenges in scaling up data sets for speech decoding.
- Most speech decoding models do not train on data from multiple subjects or combine different sources.
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach for domains with limited labeled data.
- SSL involves pre-training a model on unlabeled data by creating implicit training labels through data transformations.
- The proposed SSL tasks aim to learn from unlabeled brain data and develop an architecture for multi-sensor neuroimaging signals.
- The method allows scaling existing non-invasive data sets by incorporating data from other experiments as unlabeled.
- The results demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling with unlabeled data in speech decoding.
- The approach shows the ability of representations to generalize across data sets, tasks, and subjects.
- Previous work in speech decoding has mainly focused on supervised learning models.
- Supervised learning models struggle to generalize across participants or experiments.
- The proposed approach aims to enable cross-data set, task, and subject generalization in speech decoding.
- The neural architecture encodes diverse brain signals into latent representations through pretext tasks.
- The two-stage network architecture involves pre-training with pretext tasks on unlabeled data and fine-tuning with labeled data.
- Normalization techniques and subject conditioning enhance model performance across different subjects and data sets.
- Pretext tasks include band prediction, phase shift prediction, and amplitude scale prediction.
- The final pre-training loss is a combination of the losses from individual pretext tasks.
- The experiments assess the representations learned through pretext tasks by examining downstream performance with unlabeled data.
- MEG data is used due to its rich signal quality, superior spatial resolution, and faster sampling rates than fMRI.
- Over 200 hours of MEG data are utilized, making it the largest MEG data set used for speech analysis to date.
- Pre-processing includes applying filters to remove artifacts and noise, downsampling the signal, and identifying faulty sensor channels.
- Speech detection and voicing classification are foundational steps towards accurate speech decoding into natural language.
- Pre-training with unlabeled data significantly enhances downstream generalization, outperforming supervised baselines.
- Incorporating labels from other speech decoding tasks did not significantly boost downstream accuracy.
- Self-supervised losses remain the primary factor influencing accuracy in generalizing models to new subjects.
- Subject conditioning methods improved in-distribution subject generalization, with FiLM being the most effective.
- For novel subject generalization, conditioning methods had minimal impact, leading to reduced accuracy.
- The focus on speech detection and voice classification tasks is just the beginning towards predicting full transcripts from brain recordings.
- Achieving brain-to-text with non-invasive methods like MEG or EEG remains a challenge.
