# SUMMARY
The text discusses the growth of neural models, the importance of model weights, and introduces the concept of a model tree to depict genetic relationships between models. It proposes the task of model tree heritage recovery (Mother) to map these relationships, using outlier values in model weights and their evolution during training.
