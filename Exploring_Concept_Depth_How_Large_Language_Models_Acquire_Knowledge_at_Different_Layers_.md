# SUMMARY
The paper introduces "concept depth" to measure where large language models (LLMs) understand knowledge. Experiments reveal basic concepts are learned at shallow levels, while complex concepts require deeper levels.

# IDEAS:
- Larger models with more parameters tend to perform better due to vast encoded knowledge.
- Significant performance improvements, known as emergent abilities, occur when model parameters increase.
- It remains unclear how and where LLMs truly comprehend knowledge.
- Concept depth measures where different LLMs understand knowledge on various data sets.
- Basic concepts are typically learned at a shallow level of concept depth.
- More complex concepts require deeper levels across different LLMs.
- Deconstructing LLM capabilities provides insights into robustness from a concept depth perspective.
- Not all layers of LLMs are essential; some may not be used effectively.
- Pruning involves removing unnecessary parameters from the model, revealing redundancy.
- Probes trained with logistic regression classify the accuracy of LLMs effectively.
- Concept depth appears in LLMs and is analyzed using linear classifier probes.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) visualizes representations from each layer of LLMs.
- Nine data sets covering human emotions, logical reasoning, and factual analysis were used.
- Noise was introduced by adding random strings to input questions to test robustness.
- Quantization settings at 8bit, 16bit, and 32bit were explored to see impact on concept depth.
- Jump point indicates a significant boost in accuracy, highlighting model's recognition of critical features.
- Converging point shows when the model's learning plateaus or reaches peak capacity.
- Ablation details layer-wise accuracy of all nine LLMs over nine different data sets.
- LLMs show varying accuracy trends across layers for different concepts.
- Larger models tend to reach peak comprehension at lower layers for certain tasks.
- Different LLM families may employ diverse mechanisms to tackle the same problems.
- Noise in input data can hinder the LLM's learning process, making it slower to reach an optimal solution.
- Compressing LLMs to 16 bits is a good strategy for future designs.
- Probing technology can transform machine learning and speed up inference in large models.
- Targeted model pruning can significantly accelerate inference in large language models.
