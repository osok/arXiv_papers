# SUMMARY
The text explores how large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) benefit from in-context learning (ICL) by using demonstrating examples before a test query. Experiments show that increasing the number of demonstrating examples significantly enhances model performance, especially for Gemini 1.5 Pro.

# IDEAS:
- In-context learning (ICL) uses demonstrating examples before a test query to improve model performance.
- Few-shot multimodal ICL can enhance LMM performance on tasks outside their usual domain.
- Increasing the number of demonstrating examples has been limited by small model context windows.
- Advancements in models like GPT-40 and Gemini 1.5 Pro allow for longer context windows.
- Experiments tested model performance on 10 datasets covering various domains and image classification tasks.
- Providing many demonstrating examples significantly boosts performance compared to just a few examples.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro's performance improves in a log-linear manner as the number of examples increases.
- GPT-40 shows less consistent improvements with increasing demonstrating examples.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates higher data efficiency under ICL compared to GPT-40 on most datasets.
- Batch processing multiple queries together can achieve similar or better performance than individual queries.
- Batch processing questions can lead to notable performance enhancements in a zero-shot scenario.
- Domain and class calibration, as well as self-generated examples during decoding, contribute to performance improvements.
- Related work highlights the benefits of batch querying for more efficient and cost-effective inference.
- Experiments focus on the impact of increasing demonstrating examples on GPT-40 and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
- Ablation studies were conducted to understand the effects of batching queries.
- GPT-40 outperforms GPT-4 V Turbo significantly, so the focus is on GPT-40 and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
- Models were evaluated on datasets covering natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery.
- Balanced class distribution was ensured in demo and test sets for each dataset.
- Standard metrics like accuracy and macro-averaged F1 were used for evaluating model performance.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently improved with more demonstrating examples across most datasets.
- GPT-40 exhibited performance improvements with many-shot ICL but not uniformly across all datasets.
- Different prompts had minimal effect on the overall improvement trend with many-shot ICL.
- Both models benefited significantly from many-shot ICL at the optimal demo set size.
- Increasing the number of queries in each batch can lead to minimal performance changes or improvements.
- Using a single query at a time is not optimal for many datasets except for CH expert and EuroSAT.
- The optimal batch size tends to be among the three largest sizes for most datasets.
- Performance significantly improves with the highest batch size on three datasets in zero-shot scenarios.
- Including more images in the domain and incorporating self-generated labels can improve performance.
- Batching queries can significantly reduce latency and costs in both zero-shot and many-shot scenarios.

# INSIGHTS:
- In-context learning (ICL) enhances model performance by using demonstrating examples before a test query.
- Few-shot multimodal ICL improves LMM performance on tasks outside their usual domain.
