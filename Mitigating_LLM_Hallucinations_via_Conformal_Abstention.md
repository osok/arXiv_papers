# SUMMARY
The text discusses methods to address hallucinations in language model (LLM) responses by introducing a principled abstention policy, leveraging conformal prediction techniques, and self-evaluation prompts to ensure reliable performance.

# IDEAS:
- Hallucinations in LLMs generate incorrect or nonsensical answers that are hard to detect.
- A principled abstention policy can provide reliable responses or abstain from answering.
- Conformal prediction techniques and self-evaluation prompts minimize hallucination risks.
- The method does not require modifying the LLM model itself.
- Calibration data sets help determine optimal thresholds for abstention policies.
- Score functions like match count and expected match count offer computational tradeoffs.
- Match functions derived from similarity scores evaluate response accuracy.
- Conformal abstention ensures the final policy is close to optimal using calibration data.
- High probability guarantees enhance decision-making reliability over samples.
- Conformal risk control (CRC) framework tunes parameters based on calibration data.
- RCPS methods provide high probability guarantees even for non-monotonic loss functions.
- Empirical Bernstein inequality and WBY Smith Rhas inequality are used for non-binary losses.
- Proper calibration of match functions ensures accurate error rate estimation.
- Selective classification designs an abstention policy within a specified risk bound.
- Token probabilities quantify uncertainty but may be less effective for longer texts.
- LLM self-prompting measures model uncertainty but may not be as effective as sampling techniques.
- Conformal prediction creates confidence sets of text outputs with high probability.
- Ensemble methods train multiple models on perturbed data to estimate confidence intervals.
- Experiments test hypotheses related to conformal extension loss measurement and scoring methods.
- Match count and expected match count methods outperform log probability scoring methods.
