# SUMMARY
The text discusses methods to address hallucinations in language model (LLM) responses by introducing a principled abstention policy, leveraging conformal prediction techniques, and self-evaluation prompts to ensure reliable performance.

# IDEAS:
- Hallucinations in LLMs generate incorrect or nonsensical answers that are hard to detect.
- A principled abstention policy can provide reliable responses or abstain from answering.
- Conformal prediction techniques and self-evaluation prompts minimize hallucination risks.
- The method does not require modifying the model itself and is based on prompting.
- Calibration methods ensure accurate match predictions even with small calibration data sets.
- Score functions like match count and expected match count offer different computational tradeoffs.
- Match functions derived from similarity scores help evaluate response accuracy.
- Conformal abstention aims to create a post-processing method ensuring optimal policy performance.
- The loss function decreases as the parameter Lambda increases, aiding in tuning.
- High probability guarantees enhance decision-making reliability over samples.
- Conformal risk control (CRC) framework helps tune Lambda based on calibration data.
- Amplification techniques can strengthen high probability guarantees for CRC procedures.
- Reliable guarantees on calibration data motivate the introduction of rcps methods.
- Rcps methods handle non-monotonic loss functions and provide high probability outcomes.
- Upper confidence bounds for rcps include empirical Bernstein and WBY Smith rhas inequalities.
- Calibrating the match function involves selecting a threshold beta to minimize errors.
- Proper calibration of beta ensures the match function reflects ground truth accurately.
- Related work explores selective classification, uncertainty quantification, and hallucination detection.
- Generating multiple responses and comparing them to a reference response helps detect hallucinations.
- Token probabilities and self-prompting measure model uncertainty but have limitations.
