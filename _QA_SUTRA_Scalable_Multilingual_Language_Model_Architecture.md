# SUMMARY
The Sutra model, developed to address limitations in existing multilingual large language models (LLMs), aims to bridge linguistic gaps and enhance real-time capabilities.

# IDEAS:
- Sutra model addresses limitations in existing multilingual LLMs by mitigating linguistic inequality.
- It aims to perform downstream tasks in any supported language without defaulting to English.
- Separates concept learning from language learning for better linguistic nuance preservation.
- Uses specialized neural machine translation (NMT) mechanisms for language-specific processing.
- Provides internet-connected, hallucination-free models for real-time, factual responses.
- Built on Transformer architecture with enhancements for efficiency in computation and memory.
- Utilizes a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy for engaging relevant experts based on tasks.
- Training data includes over 100 million conversations in real and synthetically translated pairs.
- Tokenization involves a sentence piece tokenizer merged with a pre-trained English tokenizer.
- Evaluated on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MML) Benchmark.
- Consistent performance across languages, outperforming leading models in multilingual tasks.
- Reliable solution for international businesses, educational platforms, and cross-cultural communication.
- Online connectivity allows for up-to-date information, superior to search engine-augmented models.
- Validated through comprehensive evaluation on several benchmarks including MML tasks.
- Demonstrated nuanced comprehension and reasoning abilities across 57 subjects.
- Extended evaluation to multiple languages like English, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, and Indian languages.
- Surpassed GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 7B in multilingual performance by 20-30%.
