# SUMMARY
The text discusses speculative sampling and the Eagle method to speed up large language models (LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy, focusing on drafting and verification phases.

# IDEAS:
- Speculative sampling speeds up LLMs by guessing and verifying text pieces.

- Verification phase checks the draft's probabilities to ensure quality.
- Eagle can triple text generation speed without compromising quality.
- Eagle is simple to implement and doesn't require fine-tuning the original model.
- Auto-regressive decoding is slow and costly for LLMs.
- Speculative sampling divides text generation into low-cost guessing and parallel verification.
- Eagle achieves a draft accuracy of approximately 0.8.
- Eagle offers a 3X acceleration for certain models while maintaining text distribution.
- Features from the second-to-last layer of LLMs are crucial for Eagle's efficiency.
- Vanilla auto-regression converts input tokens into embeddings, then features, and finally predicts the next token.
- Speculative sampling uses a smaller model to generate draft sequences quickly.
- Auto-regressing at the feature level leads to higher accuracy and speed.
- Uncertainty in predicting the next feature affects text generation efficiency.
- Eagle's drafting model includes embedding, LM head, and auto-regression head modules.
