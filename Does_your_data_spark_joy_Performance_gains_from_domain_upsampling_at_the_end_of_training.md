# SUMMARY
The text discusses improving pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) like Dolma by using domain upsampling at the end of training, enhancing performance on challenging benchmarks.

# IDEAS:
- Pre-training datasets for LLMs consist of web-scraped data and high-quality domain-specific sources.
- Balancing Common Crawl (CC) data and domain-specific data is a key challenge in LLM pre-training.
- Recent LLMs often lack detailed information about their pre-training data.
- Optimizing data mix proportions algorithmically has not been widely validated for modern LLMs.
- Adjusting data mixture at the end of training can improve LLM performance cost-effectively.
- Domain upsampling increases the presence of domain-specific datasets relative to Common Crawl.
- Domain upsampling led to significant performance improvements on MML, GSM 8K, and HumanEval benchmarks.
- The approach made the model comparable to Llama 2 with half the training flops.
- Optimal domain upsampling percentage is between 10% and 20% of training.
- Removing math-heavy pre-training data helps quantify its impact on specific benchmarks.
- Baseline data mix categorized into large-scale CC, small-scale CC, domain-specific, and code data.
- Initial pre-training mix aligned with or outperformed Llama 2 scaling on various metrics.
- Domain upsampling for the last 20% of training improved performance on challenging benchmarks.
- Enhancements were notable in math and code-related metrics, scoring 10 percentage points higher than Llama 2.
- Domain upsampling boosts overall model performance without compromising language modeling capabilities.
- Adjusting domain upsampling duration helps balance specific domains and general-purpose language models.
- Benchmarks related to math and programming improve with increased domain upsampling.
- Other benchmarks peak at around 20% domain upsampling, suggesting a trade-off.
- Math-related datasets significantly contribute to the model's mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills.
- Removing math-related datasets decreases performance compared to the baseline model without domain upsampling.
- Domain upsampling provides a cost-efficient method to measure the impact of different datasets on model performance.
