# SUMMARY
The section discusses improving pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) by using domain upsampling at the end of training, enhancing performance on challenging benchmarks.

# IDEAS:
- Pre-training datasets for LLMs consist of web-scraped data and high-quality domain-specific sources.
- Balancing web-scraped and domain-specific data is a key challenge in LLM pre-training.
- Recent LLMs often lack detailed information about their pre-training data.
- Domain upsampling at the end of training can improve LLM performance cost-effectively.
- Initial experiments used a baseline mix of publicly available datasets.
- Domain upsampling increased the presence of domain-specific data relative to Common Crawl.
- This approach led to significant performance improvements on challenging benchmarks.
- Performance improvements were up to 6.90 percentage points on MML and 8.26 on GSM 8K.
- The model achieved comparable performance to Llama 2 with half the training flops.
- Optimal domain upsampling percentage was found to be between 10% and 20%.
- Selectively removing math-heavy data helped quantify its impact on specific benchmarks.
- Baseline data mix categorized datasets into large-scale, small-scale, domain-specific, and code data.
- Proportions were based on the number of epochs each group would be seen during training.
- Initial pre-training data mix aligned with or outperformed Llama 2 scaling on various metrics.
- Domain upsampling for the last 20% of training focused on domain-specific and code subsets.
- This intervention improved performance on math and code-related metrics by approximately 10 PP.
- Domain upsampling did not compromise general language modeling capabilities.
- Adjusting domain upsampling duration helps balance specific domains and general-purpose models.
- Benchmarks related to math and programming improved with increased domain upsampling.
- Other benchmarks peaked at around 20% domain upsampling or earlier.
- Pushing domain upsampling beyond 20% may enhance specific areas but reduce general abilities.
- Math-related data sets significantly contributed to mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills.
- Removing math-related data sets decreased performance compared to the baseline model.
- Domain upsampling provides a cost-efficient way to measure the impact of different datasets.
- Researchers can experiment with pre-training datasets without extensive training runs.
