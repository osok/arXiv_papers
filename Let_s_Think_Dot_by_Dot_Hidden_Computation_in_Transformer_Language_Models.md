# SUMMARY
The study explores how filler tokens can enhance language model (LM) performance, particularly in complex tasks, by enabling cross-token computation. Despite current large language models like Claude 2 and GPT-3.5 not benefiting from filler tokens, the research shows that Transformers trained on next-token prediction tasks can achieve improved accuracy within a specific complexity class.
