# SUMMARY
Researchers explore how filler tokens can enhance language model performance, particularly in complex tasks, by enabling cross-token computation. They find that while current large language models like Claude 2 and GPT-3.5 do not benefit from filler tokens on common tasks, Transformers trained on next token prediction tasks can achieve improved accuracy and extend their expressive power within a specific complexity class when provided with filler tokens.
