# SUMMARY
The paper discusses estimating latent knowledge in large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, introducing a new method called I-ELK that leverages in-context learning to improve reliability over previous approaches.

# IDEAS:
- Conversational chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT use large language models for tasks like information retrieval.
- Ensuring the accuracy of information provided by language models is a significant concern.
- Language models need factual knowledge about real-world entities to be reliable.
- Previous methods represented knowledge as triplets (e.g., Einstein birth year 1879).
- Current approaches face issues with prompt engineering and reliability of estimates.
- The usefulness of estimates may prioritize machine-extractable facts over human-understandable knowledge.
- I-ELK leverages in-context learning to address concerns about latent knowledge estimation.
- I-ELK outperforms other approaches across various models and types of factual relations.
- Systematic comparison of latent knowledge in 49 open-source language models reveals differences.
- Standardizing tests to estimate knowledge reliably is a challenge.
- Crafting human-understandable prompts can be tricky due to the stochastic nature of language models.
- Model internals-based approaches use internal mechanisms like attention maps to extract factual information.
- Model responses-based approaches analyze the probability distribution of generated tokens for knowledge estimation.
- Prompt-based approaches can be fragile and rely on the assumption that the LLM understands them.
- I-ELK minimizes the LLM's understanding of prompts and develops a knowledge estimation method based on in-context learning.
- The challenge lies in probing the LLM and evaluating its responses to determine if it knows a specific fact.
- In-context learning conveys information about relations without additional instructions to the LLM.
- I-ELK uses a list of facts related to a relation to enable the model to understand subject-object relationships.
- Evaluating model outputs involves assessing probabilities assigned to tokens of the corresponding object.
- Multiple-choice testing determines if the LLM knows a fact by selecting the correct object from plausible alternatives.
- I-ELK design adheres to principles by enabling relative probability comparisons using consistent prompts.
- Exploring the design space of I-ELK involves deciding the right number of in-context examples included in the input.
- More knowledgeable models require fewer in-context examples for effective knowledge estimation.
- LLMs can identify relation patterns with a small set of in-context examples but struggle with incorrect examples.
- Designing an LKE involves extracting knowledge by analyzing output probabilities of the LLM.
- The LKE's task is to identify facts known by the LLM within a knowledge graph.
- Extracting knowledge involves comparing probabilities assigned to true facts with those assigned to incorrect alternatives.
- Using a basic prompting strategy, the method can be applied to various LLMs without assuming text generation methods.
- Evaluating the approach involves metrics like probability mass function (PMF) and precision.
- Experiments show I-ELK outperforms prompt-based approaches in estimating factual knowledge across various LLMs.
- Larger models within the same family tend to have more embedded knowledge compared to smaller counterparts.
- Fine-tuning generally reduces the amount of extractable latent knowledge in models.
