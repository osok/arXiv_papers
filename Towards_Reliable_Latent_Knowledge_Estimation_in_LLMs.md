# SUMMARY
The paper discusses estimating latent knowledge in large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT. It introduces a new method, I-ELK, leveraging in-context learning to improve accuracy and reliability over previous approaches.

# IDEAS:
- Conversational chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT use large language models for tasks like information retrieval.
- Ensuring the accuracy of information provided by language models is a significant concern.
- Language models are trained on vast data, including sources like Wikipedia, to learn about the world.
- Previous methods represented knowledge as triplets: subject, relation, object (e.g., Einstein birth year 1879).
- The challenge is to infer the object given the subject and relation using only the language model.
- Current approaches face issues with prompt engineering and reliability of estimates.
- Estimates may prioritize machine-extractable facts over human-understandable knowledge.
- I-ELK leverages in-context learning to address these concerns and improve reliability.
- I-ELK outperforms other approaches across various models and types of factual relations.
- Systematic comparison of latent knowledge in 49 open-source language models reveals differences.
- Standardizing tests to estimate knowledge reliably is a significant challenge.
- Crafting human-understandable prompts can be tricky due to the stochastic nature of language models.
- Model internals-based approaches use mechanisms like attention maps to extract factual information.
- Model responses-based approaches analyze the probability distribution of generated tokens for knowledge estimation.
- Prompt-based approaches can be fragile and rely on the assumption that the LLM understands them.
- I-ELK minimizes the LLM's understanding of prompts and develops a knowledge estimation method based on in-context learning.
- The goal is to recall many true facts while being precise and not recalling false facts.
- In-context learning is used to convey information about relations without additional instructions.
- The number of in-context examples needed varies with the model's knowledge level.
- Models are robust to unknown examples but struggle with incorrect examples in a continuous sequence.
- Extracting knowledge involves analyzing output probabilities of the LLM.
- The LKE's task is to identify facts that the LLM is aware of within a knowledge graph.
- The extraction process can involve prompting the LLM effectively or training a classifier.
- Comparing probabilities assigned to true facts with those assigned to plausible but incorrect alternatives helps determine knowledge.
- Using a basic prompting strategy, the method can be applied to various LLMs without assuming text generation methods.
- Evaluating models on a wide range of facts from the T-Rex dataset shows I-ELK outperforms prompt-based approaches.
- Larger models within the same family tend to have more embedded knowledge compared to smaller counterparts.
- Fine-tuned models generally have lower accuracy than their base versions, indicating reduced extractable latent knowledge.
- Fine-tuning may not necessarily add new knowledge but rather refine existing knowledge.
