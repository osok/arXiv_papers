# SUMMARY
The paper presents a framework for aligning language models with regulatory documents, focusing on data generation, instruction styles, and continuous evaluation.

# IDEAS:
- The framers module identifies key information from regulatory documents like IBM business conduct guidelines.
- Fine-tuning data aligns models accurately by extracting enforceable policies and creating various instruction styles.
- Leveraging language models (LLMs) produces synthetic examples to amass a robust data set for training.
- Seed data aligns models with specific tasks and policies through diverse task instructions using LLMs.
- Summarization and question-answering instruction types enhance the adaptability of the models.
- Synthetic data generation using LLMs augments the training data set by filtering out malformed examples.
- Scenario style data includes compliant, non-compliant, and ambiguous scenarios for effective classification.
- Ontologies and knowledge graphs tailored to BCG use cases clarify ambiguous statements and relations.
- The instructor's module instills desired values and behaviors through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
- Aggregation techniques resolve conflicting values and behaviors in the instructor's module.
- The auditor component evaluates the model against desired criteria and regulations using curated test cases.
- Red teaming uncovers potential deficiencies and ensures continual control over the model's behavior.
- Comparing outputs of aligned and unaligned models identifies areas requiring specific alignment to regulations.
- Continuous evaluation and improvement through dynamic auditing enhance the model's performance over time.
- Ongoing baselines and red teaming activities ensure alignment with regulatory standards.
