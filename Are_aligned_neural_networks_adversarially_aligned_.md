- Adversarial examples were initially studied in image classification but have expanded to text.
- Current alignment techniques defend against existing NLP attacks but may not be robust against adversarial inputs.
- Multimodal models process both text and image inputs, potentially leading to harmful content generation.
- Advanced NLP attacks could trigger adversarial behavior in alignment-trained text-only models.
- Highly advanced language models should be aligned to prevent potential threats to humanity.
