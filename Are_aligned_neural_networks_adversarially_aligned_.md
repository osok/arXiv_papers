- Adversarial examples were initially studied in image classification and expanded to text.
- Current alignment techniques defend against existing NLP attacks but may not be robust.
- Multimodal models process both text and image inputs, posing new adversarial risks.
- Enhanced NLP attacks could trigger adversarial behavior in text-only models.
- Advanced language models should be aligned to prevent potential threats to humanity.
- Practical security risks exist for today's machine learning models.
