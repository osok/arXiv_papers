# SUMMARY
The text discusses the creation and refinement of a benchmark for converting visual website designs into functional code using multimodal large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4V.

# IDEAS:
- Integrating CSS code directly into HTML files for each web page.
- Turning visual website designs into working code is complex.
- Automatically converting visual designs into functional code could democratize web development.
- Multimodal LLMs can process both visual and textual inputs.
- Flamingo and GPT-4V are examples of advanced multimodal models.
- Design-to-code task involves converting screenshots into functional web pages.
- Created a benchmark using real-world web pages from the C4 validation set.
- The benchmark includes 484 diverse, high-quality web pages.
- Automatic metrics compare generated web pages' screenshots with original screenshots.
- Text-augmented prompting enhances visual input with text extracted from the web page.
- Self-revision prompting encourages models to improve their previous outputs.
- Open-source model Design 2 Code 18B matches commercial models' performance.
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data can yield competitive results on real-world data.
- Evaluated models using both automatic metrics and human judgment.
- Human evaluators preferred AI-generated web pages in 64% of cases.
- Higher number of HTML tags indicates greater difficulty in generating accurate web pages.
- Performance in block match, text, and position quickly plateaus after initial training steps.
- Color similarity continues to improve with more training steps.
- Text-augmented prompting improves recall of text content in generated web pages.
- Self-revision prompting corrects layout mistakes and reintroduces omitted elements.
- Website VM8 outperforms in coloring and layout but adds non-existent text.
- Multimodal LLMs integrate vision transformers with large language models.
- Instruction tuning helps models handle complex image-based questions and answers.
- UI code generation involves reverse engineering mobile user interfaces.
- Projects like Pix2Code use CNNs and RNNs for transforming UI designs into code.
- Code language models support programming tasks like automatic code completion.

# INSIGHTS:
- Integrating CSS directly into HTML simplifies the design-to-code process.
- Democratizing web development through automatic code generation can empower non-coders.
- Multimodal LLMs bridge the gap between visual design and functional code.
- Real-world benchmarks ensure models are tested on practical, diverse scenarios.
- Text-augmented prompting reduces the burden on optical character recognition (OCR).
- Self-revision prompting leverages iterative improvement for better code generation.
- Open-source models can rival commercial ones with proper fine-tuning.
- Human preferences highlight the importance of high-level visual effects in web design.
- Training on synthetic data can effectively prepare models for real-world applications.
- Higher HTML tag counts correlate with increased difficulty in code generation tasks.
