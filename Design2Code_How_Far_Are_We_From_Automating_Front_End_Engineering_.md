# SUMMARY
The text discusses the creation and refinement of a benchmark for converting visual website designs into functional code using multimodal large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4V.

# IDEAS:
- Integrating CSS code directly into HTML files simplifies web page processing.
- Turning visual website designs into working code is complex and requires advanced coding skills.
- Automatically converting visual designs into functional code could democratize web development.
- Multimodal LLMs can process both visual and textual inputs to generate text outputs.
- Flamingo and GPT-4V are examples of advanced multimodal models.
- The task of converting design to code is called "design 2 code."
- A real-world benchmark for design 2 code was created using actual web pages.
- The benchmark includes 484 high-quality, diverse examples from the C4 validation set.
- Automatic metrics compare generated web pages' screenshots with original screenshots.
- Text-augmented prompting enhances visual input with text extracted from the web page.
- Self-revision prompting encourages models to improve their previous outputs.
- Open-source model Design 2 Code 18B performed on par with commercial models.
- Fine-tuning smaller models with synthetic data can yield competitive results.
- The benchmark covers a wide range of HTML tag usage, domains, and complexity levels.
- High-level visual similarity and low-level element matching are used for evaluation.
- Human judgment correlates well with automatic metrics in evaluating web pages.
- Text-augmented prompting improves block match and text similarity scores.
- Self-revision prompting shows positive effects only on GPT-4V.
- Fine-tuning open-source models can achieve transparency and competitive performance.
- Human evaluators preferred AI-generated web pages in 64% of cases.
- Higher number of HTML tags indicates greater difficulty in generating web pages.
- Performance in areas like block match, text, and position quickly plateaued after training steps.
- Generating accurate color codes benefits significantly from HTML training data.
- Multimodal LLMs integrate vision transformers with large language models for better adaptability.
- Instruction tuning broadens training data and incorporates grounding and OCR elements.
- UI code generation involves reverse engineering mobile user interfaces using OCR and edge detection.
- Projects like Pix2Code use CNNs and RNNs to transform UI designs into code.
- Code language models like Codex and Code Llama support programming tasks like code completion.

# INSIGHTS:
- Integrating CSS into HTML files simplifies web page processing and consolidation.
- Democratizing web development through automatic design-to-code conversion empowers non-coders.
- Multimodal LLMs bridge the gap between visual design and functional code generation.
- Real-world benchmarks ensure practical evaluation of design-to-code models.
- Text-augmented prompting reduces OCR burden, improving model performance.
- Self-revision prompting enhances model output by encouraging iterative improvement.
- Smaller, fine-tuned open-source models can rival commercial counterparts in performance.
- High-level visual similarity and low-level element matching provide comprehensive evaluation metrics.
- Human evaluators often prioritize high-level visual effects over detailed content accuracy.
- Higher HTML tag counts correlate with increased difficulty in generating accurate web pages.
