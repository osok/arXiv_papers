# SUMMARY
The section explores the limitations of Transformer architecture in AI, particularly its struggles with function composition and sequential tasks, and potential solutions.

# IDEAS:
- Transformers sometimes produce hallucinations, generating answers not aligned with training data or questions.
- Theoretical limitations of Transformers include recognizing simple patterns like balanced parentheses or even negations.
- These limitations emerge with very large inputs, uncommon in practical scenarios.
- Transformers can handle simple pattern recognition tasks well within realistic settings.
- Transformers fall into a relatively weak complexity class, revealing computational boundaries.
- Specific mathematical challenges for Transformers include identifying three numbers summing to zero.
- Transformers struggle with function composition, crucial for combining relational data and language understanding.
- Integrating knowledge graphs with Transformers may improve function composition and reduce hallucinations.
- Handling indexicals illustrates the importance of function composition in language understanding.
- A single Transformer attention layer struggles with function composition if domain size exceeds a threshold.
- Softmax computation in Transformers relies on limited non-local information for next token embedding.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) approach can mitigate function composition issues by breaking tasks into smaller steps.
- Even with CoT, a larger prompt is needed for multiple function compositions.
- Transformers struggle with tasks requiring sequential composition, increasing with depth of composition.
- Probabilistic nature of Transformers can lead to unreliable outputs, especially with low probability inputs.
- Ambiguous or underspecified input contexts increase likelihood of generating incorrect tokens and hallucinations.
- Self-attention units in Transformers transform input vectors into output vectors using key, query, and value matrices.
- Function composition problem involves combining two functions through a structured prompt.
- Insufficient Transformer layer capacity leads to failure in solving function composition problems.
- Communication complexity principles show Transformer layer's capacity limits function composition accuracy.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) approach helps solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler steps.
- Iterated function composition problems require a proportional number of CoT steps to domain size and Transformer parameters.
- Multi-layer Transformers operate within a logarithmic memory space, limiting complex reasoning capabilities.
- Certain complexity conjectures suggest multi-layer Transformers can't solve specific problems without violating assumptions.
- Performance drops significantly as task depth exceeds a certain threshold, aligning with computational complexity limits.
- Complexity arguments highlight fundamental mismatches between certain problems and Transformer architecture.
- Empirical evidence shows Transformers struggle with small compositionality tasks and make errors in function composition prompts.
- Some NP-complete problems like 3-SAT are solvable in practice due to tailored algorithmic techniques.
