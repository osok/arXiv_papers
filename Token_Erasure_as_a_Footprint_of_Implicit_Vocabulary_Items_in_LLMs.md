# SUMMARY
The text discusses how large language models (LLMs) process text, focusing on tokenization and the formation of meaningful lexical items.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs convert groups of subword tokens into meaningful representations, a process known as tokenization.
- During training, LLMs develop a hidden vocabulary mapping tokens to meaningful units.
- These units are non-compositional, meaning their meanings can't be predicted from individual tokens.
- The last token positions of multi-token words play a crucial role in erasing token-level information.
- This eraser effect indicates a mechanism in early layers forming meaningful lexical items.
- Information about multi-token entities is often concentrated in the last token of that entity.
- Decoder Transformer models enrich information about an entity at its last token in early layers.
- LLMs encode lexical items in their representations, as shown by previous research.
- Hidden states in LLMs encode information about other subject tokens.
- Linear probes predict nearby tokens based on hidden states at different layers and token positions.
- The eraser effect helps form meaningful lexical items in early layers of LLMs.
- The CNT-RFA dataset contains prompts requiring factual knowledge to answer correctly.
- Filtering the dataset resulted in 12,135 correctly answered prompts for LLaMA 2-7B.
- The hidden states of the last tokens of CNT-RFA subjects consistently forgot preceding and current tokens.
- This drop in token accuracy is similar to the subject enrichment stage.
- The eraser effect is not specific to the CNT-RFA dataset, as seen with named entities in Wikipedia articles.
- Multi-token words are processed similarly to multi-token entities in early layers.
- The eraser score identifies token sequences exhibiting the observed pattern.
- An algorithm segments documents into high-score, non-overlapping sequences based on eraser scores.
- Top-scoring sequences represent plausible non-compositional lexical items.
- The method uncovers the hidden vocabulary of a model using a dataset.
- Around 1,800 sequences were identified for LLaMA 2-7B and about 900 for LLaMA 3-8B.
- Almost 45% of sequences found for LLaMA 2-7B in Wikipedia text are multi-word terms or entities.
- LLaMA 3-8B's implicit vocabulary includes more multi-word expressions and code segments.

# INSIGHTS:
- LLMs develop hidden vocabularies mapping arbitrary tokens to semantically meaningful units during training.
- The last token positions play a crucial role in forming meaningful lexical items in early layers.
- Information about multi-token entities is concentrated in the last token due to decoder Transformer models.
- The eraser effect helps form meaningful lexical items by erasing token-level information in early layers.
- Multi-token words and entities are processed similarly, indicating a shared mechanism in early layers.
- The eraser score quantifies the erasing behavior at token positions within a sequence.
- An algorithm segments documents into high-score sequences representing non-compositional lexical items.
- LLaMA models' hidden vocabularies include multi-word terms, entities, expressions, and code segments.
