# SUMMARY
The USACO Benchmark, introduced by researchers, includes 307 challenging problems from past USA Computing Olympiad competitions. These problems require diverse algorithmic, mathematical, and creative reasoning skills. Despite improvements using retrieval and self-reflection methods, language models like GPT-4 still struggle to solve these problems at higher levels, highlighting the need for further research in competitive programming and model reasoning.
