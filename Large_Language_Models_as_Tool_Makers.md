# SUMMARY
The paper proposes a framework called LLMs as Tool Makers (LATM) that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate reusable tools for new tasks, enhancing problem-solving capabilities and reducing computational costs.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs have shown promising steps towards achieving aspects of broad-spectrum artificial intelligence.
- Enhancing LLMs with external tools can significantly improve their problem-solving skills and efficiency.
- The LATM framework empowers LLMs to design their own reusable tools for handling new tasks.
- The tool-making process is handled by a highly competent model like GPT-4.
- The tool-using process is assigned to a more lightweight and economical model like GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- This approach cuts down the average computational cost for addressing a series of tasks.
- The dispatcher assesses whether an incoming problem can be solved using existing tools or if a new tool needs to be created.
- LATM can match the performance of more resource-intensive models while remaining cost-effective.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
- External tools like calculators, search engines, and translation systems can enhance LLM capabilities.
- LATM uses Python executors to create reusable tools for various task instances.
- Adaptive generation in LLMs can enhance text generation efficiency by controlling the decoding process.
- Language model cascades can amplify LLM capabilities by combining multiple models.
- LATM assigns individual tasks within a category to a smaller model for better efficiency.
- The tool-making stage involves proposing, verifying, and wrapping tools.
- The tool user utilizes the verified tool to handle various versions of the task.
- The dispatcher determines whether to engage the tool user or tool maker for each incoming task.
- LATM was tested on six datasets from different fields, including logical deduction and scheduling meetings.
- The tool verification stage provides examples illustrating how to translate natural language queries into function calls.
- LATM improves the performance of lightweight LLMs compared to CoT prompting.
- The dispatcher can efficiently recognize existing tools and request new ones for unseen tasks.

# INSIGHTS:
- Enhancing LLMs with external tools mirrors human evolution in creating and using tools.
- LATM's two-step design optimizes performance and cost by assigning roles to suitable LLMs.
- The dispatcher adds dynamism by enabling real-time tool-making and usage.
- LATM's approach is scalable and cost-efficient for managing complex tasks.
- Python function tools serve as a universal form of the Chain of Thought concept.
- LATM significantly reduces computational costs by reusing developed tools across tasks.
- Lightweight models can perform as well as powerful models with the help of generated tools.
- LATM's efficiency is highlighted by its ability to outperform CoT prompting at a lower cost.
- The dispatcher model ensures continuous task management by identifying and creating necessary tools.
- LATM's framework can be expanded to a continuous task setting with diverse tasks.
