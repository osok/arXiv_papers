# SUMMARY
The paper proposes a framework called LLMs as Tool Makers (LATM) that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate their own reusable tools for new tasks, enhancing problem-solving capabilities and reducing computational costs.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs have shown promising steps towards achieving broad-spectrum artificial intelligence.
- Enhancing LLMs with external tools can significantly improve their problem-solving skills.
- The LATM framework empowers LLMs to design their own reusable tools for handling new tasks.
- LATM is structured into two main stages: tool making and tool using.
- The tool making process is handled by a highly competent model like GPT-4.
- The tool using process is assigned to a more lightweight model like GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- This approach cuts down the average computational cost for addressing a series of tasks.
- The resulting tools can be reused across different tasks, making the method scalable and cost-efficient.
- A dispatcher LLM assesses whether an incoming problem can be solved using existing tools or if a new tool needs to be created.
- LATM can match the performance of more resource-intensive models while remaining cost-effective.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
- External tools like calculators, search engines, and translation systems can enhance LLM capabilities.
- LATM uses Python executors to create reusable tools for various task instances.
- Adaptive generation methods can improve text generation efficiency in LLMs.
- Language model cascades can amplify LLM capabilities by combining multiple models.
- LATM assigns individual tasks within a category to a smaller model for better efficiency.
- The tool making stage involves proposing, verifying, and wrapping tools.
- The tool user utilizes the verified tool to handle various versions of the task.
- LATM is more efficient and cost-effective compared to using a powerful model alone.
- The dispatcher determines whether to engage the tool user or tool maker for each incoming task.
- The dispatcher can identify new tasks that current tools can't tackle and engage the tool maker to create new tools.
- LATM has been tested on various datasets including logical deduction, tracking shuffled objects, and scheduling meetings.
- The tool making stage uses a slower model to generate Python functions tailored to specific tasks.
- GPT-4 frequently devises suitable algorithms for solving tasks in the tool making stage.
- LATM improves the performance of lightweight LLMs compared to CoT prompting.
- The dispatcher achieves a 94% accuracy rate in identifying the correct tool for tasks.
- A more powerful model is required for complex tasks like logical deduction and tracking shuffled objects.
- For simpler tasks, a lightweight language model can suffice as a tool creator.
- GPT-3.5 Turbo offers the best balance between performance and cost for the tool using phase.

# INSIGHTS:
