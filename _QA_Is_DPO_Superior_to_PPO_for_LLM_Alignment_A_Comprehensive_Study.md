# SUMMARY
The content discusses fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), comparing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

# IDEAS:
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the initial phase where the pre-trained model imitates high-quality demonstration data.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns the model with human preferences using reinforcement learning techniques.
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) optimizes policy directly over preference data without learning a reward model.
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) first learns a reward model from human-labeled data before optimizing the policy.
- DPO focuses solely on policy optimization based on preference data, unlike PPO which uses actor-critic algorithms.
- DPO may find biased solutions exploiting out-of-distribution responses, while PPO can leverage MPT-only data.
- PPO uses KL divergence regularization between the policy and the reference model to manage distribution issues.
- Theoretical analysis shows any solution found by PPO exploiting the reward model can also be found by DPO.
- Empirical validation shows DPO may generate biased policies favoring out-of-distribution responses.
- PPO can alleviate bias issues with explicit KL regularization, improving alignment with human preferences.
- DPO's training objective may lead to unpredictable behaviors and deviations from the reference policy.
- DPO can suffer from misspecification issues on out-of-distribution samples, affecting overall performance.
- Advantage normalization stabilizes PPO training and improves performance by normalizing advantages during training.
- Large batch size training significantly enhances PPO performance, especially on challenging tasks like code generation.
- Updating reference model parameters with exponential moving average helps PPO adapt to changing main LLM model.
- Safe RLHF dataset was used for experimental validation of DPO and PPO methods.
- DPO performed poorly initially but improved safety rate and helpfulness reward after resolving distribution shift issues.
- Both DPO and PPO generated responses with less harm, but PPO's responses were more helpful.
- PPO outperformed previous state-of-the-art model AlphaCode 41B in the code contest dataset.
- PPO achieved a significant improvement in code generation performance, showcasing its superiority.
