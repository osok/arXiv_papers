# SUMMARY
The text discusses the Block Transformer architecture, which optimizes inference throughput by separating global and local attention mechanisms into distinct stages. 

# IDEAS:
- Self-attention in Transformer models is computationally expensive due to considering all previous tokens.
- Storing key-value (KV) states of all tokens across layers during decoding is common practice.
- KV cache input-output process mainly drives inference cost for language models.
- Hierarchical global-local architectures model large-scale data by addressing global dependencies and capturing local details.
- Block Transformer architecture models global dependencies through self-attention between coarse blocks at lower layers.
- Localized self-attention eliminates costs by focusing on a small local context without computing KV cache of past tokens.
- The embedder embeds each block of input tokens into an input block embedding.
- The block decoder applies self-attention between blocks to decode a context block embedding for predicting the next block.
- The token decoder decodes the token contents of the next block using local self-attention within the block.
- Block Transformers improve inference throughput compared to vanilla Transformers while maintaining performance.
- The embedder uses a lookup table to fetch and combine trainable token embeddings.
- Block decoder contextualizes block representations by attending to preceding blocks, reducing computational costs.
- Token decoder decodes individual tokens using context block embeddings, projecting them into prefix tokens.
- Training both vanilla and block Transformer models on a dataset called The Pile with a context length of 2048.
- Block Transformer shows comparable performance to vanilla models even with two or three times more parameters.
- Efficiency improvement due to reductions in memory usage allows for larger batch size and higher throughput.
- U-shaped pattern in perplexity across different allocation ratios between block and token decoders.
- Optimal parameter ratio depends on block length, favoring larger block decoder for shorter blocks and larger token decoder for longer blocks.
- Models with larger token decoders achieve higher throughput with minor performance tradeoff.
- Lookup table strategy outperforms complex Transformer encoder like RoBERTa in terms of generation throughput.
- Prefix token decoding with longer prefixes enhances performance with minimal overhead.
- Increasing block length leads to log-linear change in training loss and exponential increase in throughput.
- Block Transformer effectively leverages full context, predicting later tokens with higher likelihood.
- Optimal block Transformer model achieves superior perplexity and triples throughput compared to vanilla model.
- Subword-level global-to-local architecture benefits from initialization from pre-trained vanilla Transformer.
- Pre-training strategy leads to near full performance recovery with just 10% of original training steps.
- Global-to-local modeling can be related to KV cache compression where past sequences are pruned in upper layers.
