# SUMMARY

The text discusses the Block Transformer architecture, which optimizes inference throughput by separating global and local attention mechanisms into distinct stages. 

# IDEAS:

- Self-attention in Transformer models is computationally expensive due to considering all previous tokens.
- Storing key-value (KV) states of all tokens across layers during decoding is common practice.
- KV cache input-output process mainly drives the inference cost for language models.
- Hierarchical global-local architectures model large-scale data by addressing global dependencies and capturing local details.
- Block Transformer architecture models global dependencies through self-attention between coarse blocks at lower layers.
- Localized self-attention eliminates costs by focusing on a small local context without computing KV cache of past tokens.
- The embedder embeds each block of input tokens into an input block embedding.
- The block decoder applies self-attention between blocks to decode a context block embedding for predicting the next block.
- The token decoder decodes the token contents of the next block using local self-attention within the block.
- Block Transformers improve inference throughput compared to vanilla Transformers while maintaining performance.
- The embedder uses a lookup table to fetch and combine trainable token embeddings.
- The block decoder reduces computational costs by using coarse-grained block inputs.
- The token decoder projects context block embedding into prefix tokens for better attention to context information.
- Block Transformers show comparable performance to vanilla models even with more parameters.
- Larger batch sizes and higher throughput are achieved due to reduced memory usage.
- A 1:1 ratio between block and token decoders is optimal for models with lcore b equals 4.
- Larger token decoders reduce perplexity at initial and later positions within a block.
- Longer block lengths and larger token decoders result in higher throughput models.
- Lookup table strategy outperforms complex Transformer encoders like Roberta in generation throughput.
- Prefix token decoding with longer prefixes enhances performance with minimal overhead.
- Increasing block length leads to a log-linear change in training loss and exponential increase in throughput.
- Block Transformer effectively leverages full context, predicting later tokens with higher likelihood.
- Optimal block Transformer model achieves superior perplexity and triples throughput compared to vanilla model.
- Subword-level global-to-local architecture benefits from initialization from a pre-trained vanilla Transformer.
- Pre-training strategy leads to near full performance recovery with minimal data.
- Global embeddings or context embeddings from previous windows can enhance performance.
- Block decoder compresses past global contexts for the token decoder's local language modeling.

# INSIGHTS:
