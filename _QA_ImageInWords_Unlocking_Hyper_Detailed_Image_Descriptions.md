# SUMMARY
The Image in Words (IW) method addresses the limitations of current Vision Language Models (VMS) by combining human annotators with machine-generated metadata to create hyper-detailed, hallucination-free image descriptions.

# IDEAS:
- IW addresses VMS limitations from noisy web datasets with ambiguous, incomplete alt text descriptions.
- Human-in-the-loop framework combines human annotators with machine-generated metadata for detailed image descriptions.
- Object detection identifies individual object instances in images as the first step.
- Vision Language Model (VM) generates granular captions for each detected object.
- Crowd workers refine object-level captions to make them richer and hallucination-free.
- An image caption is generated by VM to seed the final image description.
- Crowd workers fill in missing contextual information using image-level seed captions and object-level annotations.
- The annotation process is iterative to ensure a high-quality dataset.
- Guidelines are designed for crowd workers to address concepts beyond objects like visual perspective and spatial arrangement.
- The IW dataset contains 9,18 images with hyper-detailed descriptions.
- The dataset is evaluated through side-by-side human evaluations against other datasets.
- Fine-tuning the dataset on a poly 35b model results in superior readability metrics and improved image descriptions.
- Detailed descriptions generated by IW are used for text-to-image models and applications for visually impaired people.
- IW method combines human annotators with machine-generated metadata for hyper-detailed, hallucination-free image descriptions.
- IW annotations are more comprehensive, specific, and human-like with fewer hallucinations.
- IW dataset contains more information per description compared to other dense description datasets.
- Human-in-the-loop framework iteratively refines image descriptions for a high-quality dataset.
- IW method outperforms existing methods in fine-tuning models for generating hyper-detailed descriptions.
- IW fine-tuned models exhibit higher comprehension, specificity, and human likeness.
- Sequential augmentation in IW promotes efficient annotation process with higher quality outputs in less time.
- IW method offers a reliable way to curate image-text data leveraging human annotators and machine-generated metadata.
- IW method validated through comprehensive experiments and evaluations showcasing its richness and depth.
- Human evaluations rated IW descriptions as more comprehensive, specific, and human-like with fewer hallucinations.
