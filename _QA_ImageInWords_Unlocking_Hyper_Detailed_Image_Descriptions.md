# SUMMARY
The Image in Words (IW) method addresses the limitations of current Vision Language Models (VMS) by combining human annotators with machine-generated metadata to create detailed, hallucination-free image descriptions.

# IDEAS:
- IW addresses VMS limitations from noisy web datasets with ambiguous, incomplete alt text descriptions.
- Alt text descriptions often hinder models' capabilities in understanding and describing images accurately.
- IW introduces a human-in-the-loop framework for hyper-detailed, hallucination-free image descriptions.
- The method combines human annotators with machine-generated metadata for quality image descriptions.
- IW focuses on generating detailed descriptions for individual objects in images.
- Human annotations refine object-level captions to make them richer and hallucination-free.
- Image-level captions are generated by VMs to seed the final image description.
- Crowd workers fill in missing contextual information using image-level seed captions and object-level annotations.
- The annotation process is iterative to ensure a high-quality dataset.
- Guidelines are designed for crowd workers to attend to concepts beyond objects.
- The IW dataset contains 9,18 images with hyper-detailed descriptions.
- The dataset is evaluated through side-by-side human evaluations against other datasets.
- IW fine-tuning results in superior readability metrics and improved image descriptions.
- Detailed descriptions generated by IW are used for text-to-image models and applications for visual impairments.
- IW combines human annotators with machine-generated metadata for comprehensive, specific, human-like annotations.
- IW outperforms existing methods in fine-tuning models for generating hyper-detailed descriptions.
- IW promotes efficient annotation through sequential augmentation, resulting in higher quality outputs in less time.
- IW offers a reliable way to curate image-text data by leveraging human and machine strengths.
- IW's detailed annotations have practical applications in text-to-image models and vision-language compositional reasoning.
- IW was validated through comprehensive experiments and evaluations, showcasing its richness and depth.
- Human evaluations rated IW descriptions as more comprehensive, specific, human-like, and containing fewer hallucinations.
- IW fine-tuned models outperformed others in readability metrics, human evaluations, and downstream tasks.
- IW descriptions aided in vision-language compositional reasoning tasks, showing accuracy improvements.
- Limitations include subjective nature of detailed image description annotation and potential human annotator bias or errors.
- The iterative annotation process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
