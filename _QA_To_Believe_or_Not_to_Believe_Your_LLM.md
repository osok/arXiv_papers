# SUMMARY
The new method aims to solve hallucinations in language models by quantifying epistemic uncertainty, using mutual information to detect unreliable responses.

# IDEAS:
- The new method addresses hallucinations in language models by detecting incorrect or hallucinated responses.
- It quantifies epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of knowledge about the ground truth.
- By decoupling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, the algorithm handles multi-response queries effectively.
- The goal is to measure how far the model's output distribution is from the ground truth.
- An information-theoretic metric of epistemic uncertainty based on mutual information is used.

- The method estimates epistemic uncertainty through an iterative prompting procedure.
- It constructs a joint distribution over multiple responses derived from the language model.
- The key idea is to measure the distance between the model's distribution and the ground truth.
- Epistemic uncertainty is quantified by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
