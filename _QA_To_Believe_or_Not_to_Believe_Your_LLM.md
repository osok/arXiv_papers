# SUMMARY
The new method aims to solve hallucinations in language models by quantifying epistemic uncertainty, using mutual information to detect unreliable responses.

# IDEAS:
- The method addresses hallucinations in language models by detecting incorrect or hallucinated responses.
- It quantifies epistemic uncertainty, arising from a lack of knowledge about the ground truth.
- By decoupling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, it handles multi-response queries effectively.
- The goal is to measure how far the model's output distribution is from the ground truth.
- An information-theoretic metric of epistemic uncertainty based on mutual information is used.
- This metric allows for detecting hallucinations and provides a score-based method for abstention.
- The method estimates epistemic uncertainty through an iterative prompting procedure.
- It constructs a joint distribution over multiple responses derived from the language model.
- Epistemic uncertainty is quantified by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
- A computable lower bound on this uncertainty is derived using mutual information.
- The method applies a score-based hallucination detection algorithm with a calibrated threshold.
- The estimated uncertainty metric determines the strength of belief in the model's responses.
- The method is evaluated on various question-answering datasets, showing improved performance.
- It offers a rigorous measure of how well the language model approximates the ground truth.
- The method's reliance on Zipf distributions and concentration rates enhances practical benefits.

- Experiments compare the proposed method with several baseline methods.
- Performance is evaluated by comparing precision and recall on single-label and multi-label queries.
- Thresholds for abstention policies are determined on calibration datasets.
- Results show better performance compared to baseline methods on closed-book open-domain tasks.
- The method outperformed baselines like probability of greedy response and semantic entropy method.
