# SUMMARY
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve deep networks' generalization by regularizing the loss landscape's sharpness, focusing on clean data over noisy examples.

- SAM slows down learning of noisy examples compared to clean examples.
- SAM achieves higher test accuracy by prioritizing fitting clean training data before overfitting to noise.
- SAM is more robust to label noise than traditional optimizers like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
- SAM improves early stopping test accuracy through unique perturbation mechanisms on the logit scale and network Jacobian terms.
- 1SAM applies adversarial perturbation to each example individually, unlike naive SAM.

- 1SAM handles perturbation step focusing on each sample separately for effective regularization.
- 1SAM upweights gradients of low-loss points, particularly clean examples, during early training epochs.
- SAM's perturbation on the logit scale term results in preferentially upweighting gradients of low-loss points.
- Perturbation on the logit scale term acts as a gradient reweighting scheme in SAM.
- In deep networks, the main contributor to SAM's robustness is perturbation on the network Jacobian term.

- Regularization effect of SAM on the Jacobian term helps maintain norm of intermediate activations and last layer weights.
- SAM achieves higher early stopping test accuracy by emphasizing fitting clean training data effectively.
- SAM's benefits in improving early stopping test accuracy rely on regularization of the network Jacobian.
- Experimental investigation compared full batch gradient descent and SAM on toy Gaussian data with label noise.
- Study involved running a grid search for adversarial weight perturbation magnitude used in SAM.
- Ratio of average sample-wise gradient norm of clean versus noisy examples decayed slower with larger perturbation magnitudes in SAM.
- Explicit reweighting of low-loss points by SAM's logit scale term differs from perturbing the Jacobian term in deep networks.
