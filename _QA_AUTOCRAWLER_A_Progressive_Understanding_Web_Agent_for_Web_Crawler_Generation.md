- AUT-Crawler aims to generate predefined rules or action sequences to extract target information.
- The framework leverages HTML's hierarchical structure for progressive understanding.
- A synthesis phase enhances the reusability of action sequences generated by LLMs.
- AUT-Crawler reduces dependency on LLMs, improving efficiency in handling web tasks.
- Progressive generation phase refines down to the specific node containing target information.
- Traversal strategy involves top-down and step-back operations for accurate XPath targeting.
- Synthesis phase generates multiple action sequences and selects the most effective one.
- AUT-Crawler adapts to complexities of semi-structured data, enhancing reusability and efficiency.
- LLMs offer advanced capabilities like planning, reasoning, reflection, and tool use.
- LLMs provide higher adaptability and scalability compared to traditional wrapper methods.
- LLMs reduce dependency on manually annotated examples, enhancing efficiency.
- Experiments validate AUT-Crawler using various LLMs and datasets.
