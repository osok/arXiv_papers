# SUMMARY
The text discusses methods for improving uncertainty calibration in large language models (LLMs) and their implications for decision-making. It highlights the effectiveness of fine-tuning over zero-shot blackbox methods.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs can estimate uncertainty through prompting, but some argue they are overconfident.
- Blackbox estimation methods do not require training and can be used with models like GPT-4.
- White box methods require training parameters on a calibration data set.
- Fine-tuning LLMs for better uncertainties results in faster and more reliable estimates.
- Fine-tuned uncertainties generalize well to new question types beyond the fine-tuning data set.
- Zero-shot blackbox methods are not effective in open-ended settings.
- Fine-tuning a language model for calibration can be more efficient.
- Likelihood-based methods have limitations in open-ended generation tasks.
- Perplexity normalizes for sequence length and is used for open-ended tasks.
- Prompting methods have gained popularity as confidence measures.
- Humans often exhibit poor calibration on unfamiliar tasks.
- Alignment procedures like RHF could help improve calibration.
- Open-source models like LLaMA 2, Mistol, and LLaMA 3 are assessed in open-ended settings.
- Prompting methods tend to have poorly calibrated uncertainties.
- Fine-tuning for uncertainty outperforms even the best base model.
- Treating the task as a simple yes or no classification problem.
- Using a small neural network on the final layer features of an LLM.
- Adding low-rank adapters (LoRA) to the base model enhances correctness prediction.
- Framing correctness classification as a multiple-choice task with "no" and "yes".
- Investigating shifts in distribution between training and evaluation data sets.
- Uncertainty estimates from LoRA plus prompt demonstrate consistent performance across different subject categories.
- Language models can provide useful uncertainty estimates even with limited labeled examples.
- Models can estimate uncertainties for various other models when a small labeled data set is available.
- Calibrated uncertainties can withstand changes in data distribution.
- Fine-tuning requires separate models for question answering and uncertainty estimation.
- Incorporating uncertainty awareness during pre-training or alignment phases may become crucial.
- High-quality uncertainties can enhance active learning methods by selecting data points based on predicted utility.
- Uncertainty estimates can enhance the factual accuracy of language models by favoring confident generations.
