# SUMMARY
Researchers introduce Ditto, a self-alignment method enabling large language models (LLMs) to roleplay without advanced models, focusing on consistent role identity and accurate role-related knowledge.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs excel in understanding instructions but lack personal experiences and emotions.
- Roleplay LLMs allow users to create character profiles for more engaging interactions.
- Ditto enables LLMs to roleplay through self-alignment, eliminating the need for advanced models.
- LLMs are seen as a superposition of characters with inherent conversational styles.
- Ditto uses character profiles and attributes to align LLM responses consistently.
- Ditto is scalable and flexible, using 4,000 characters from Wikipedia.
- Evaluating roleplay is tricky; previous efforts relied on costly manual annotations.
- Ditto allows LLMs to automatically score roleplay, maintaining consistent role identity.
- Ditto achieves 90% role identity consistency on Quen 72B chat.
- General performance of Quen 72B chat matches advanced chatbots like GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Knowledge in roleplay is limited by the inherent capabilities of LLMs.
- Ditto separates character knowledge and conversation style, making it compatible with any LLM.
- Ditto creates the first multilingual dataset with 4,000 roles.
- Self-alignment improves weaker language models by fine-tuning on outputs from stronger models.
- Roleplay requires LLMs to embody specific characters for immersive interaction.
- Ditto includes character knowledge collection, dialogue simulation, and supervised fine-tuning.
- Ditto simulates roleplay dialogue as a reading comprehension task.
- Objective metrics for evaluating roleplay include consistent role identity and accurate role-related knowledge.
- Experiments show proprietary models outperform open-source models in roleplay.
- Roleplay expertise baselines have better self-awareness consistency and cognitive boundaries.
- Ditto shows robust effectiveness on LLMs of different scales.
- Injecting character knowledge during dialogue simulation improves self-simulated supervision quality.

# INSIGHTS:
- Self-alignment can effectively stimulate LLMs' intrinsic role-play abilities.
- Roleplay requires unwavering self-awareness and extensive character-specific knowledge.
- Consistent role identity benefits from imitation learning, while knowledge metrics do not.
- Stronger language models generate more accurate queries, enhancing role-play performance.
- Injecting knowledge significantly improves the quality of self-simulated supervision.
- High-quality supervision is crucial for simulating roleplay style effectively.
- Proprietary models generally outperform open-source models in roleplay capabilities.
- Roleplay expertise baselines excel in self-awareness consistency and cognitive boundaries.
- Self-aligned models can achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary chatbots.
