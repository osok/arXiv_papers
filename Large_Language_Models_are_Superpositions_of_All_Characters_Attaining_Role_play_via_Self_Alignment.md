# SUMMARY
Researchers introduce Ditto, a self-alignment method enabling large language models (LLMs) to roleplay without advanced models, focusing on consistent role identity and accurate role-related knowledge.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs excel in understanding instructions but lack personal experiences and emotions.
- Roleplay LLMs allow users to create profiles for characters to enhance engagement.
- Ditto enables LLMs to roleplay through self-alignment, eliminating the need for advanced models.
- LLMs are seen as a superposition of characters with inherent conversational styles.
- Ditto uses character profiles and attributes to align LLM responses.
- Ditto is scalable and flexible, using 4,000 characters from Wikipedia.
- Evaluating roleplay traditionally relies on costly manual annotations.
- Ditto introduces automatic scoring for roleplay evaluation.
- Ditto achieves 90% role identity consistency on Quen 72B chat.
- Proprietary models generally outperform open-source models in roleplay.
- Roleplay expertise baselines have better self-awareness and cognitive boundaries.
- Knowledge in roleplay is limited by the inherent capabilities of LLMs.
- Ditto separates character knowledge and conversation style for compatibility with any LLM.
- Ditto creates the first multilingual dataset with 4,000 roles.
- Self-alignment can cheaply improve weaker language models by fine-tuning on stronger model outputs.
- Roleplay requires LLMs to embody specific characters for immersive interaction.
- Ditto includes character knowledge collection, dialogue simulation, and supervised fine-tuning.
- Dialogue simulation involves generating role-specific and contrastive queries.
- Objective metrics for roleplay include consistent role identity, accurate knowledge, and unknown question rejection.
- Experiments show Ditto's effectiveness across different scales of LLMs.
- Injecting character knowledge during dialogue simulation improves roleplay quality.
- Stronger language models generate more accurate queries for better roleplay performance.
- Cross-supervision analyses show consistent role identity benefits from imitation learning.
- Knowledge-related metrics do not benefit as much from imitation learning.

# INSIGHTS:
- Self-alignment enables scalable and flexible roleplay capabilities in LLMs.
- Roleplay quality improves with stronger language models generating accurate queries.
- Injecting character knowledge significantly enhances self-simulated supervision quality.
- Consistent role identity benefits from imitation learning, unlike knowledge metrics.
- Proprietary models outperform open-source ones in roleplay but lack specific knowledge.
