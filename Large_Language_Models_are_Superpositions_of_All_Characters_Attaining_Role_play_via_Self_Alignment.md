# SUMMARY

Researchers introduce Ditto, a self-alignment method enabling large language models (LLMs) to roleplay without advanced models, focusing on consistent role identity and accurate role-related knowledge.

# IDEAS:

- LLMs excel in understanding instructions but lack personal experiences and emotions for engaging conversations.
- Roleplay LLMs allow users to create character profiles, enhancing conversational engagement.
- Existing methods mimic advanced models like GPT-4, posing challenges in building from scratch.
- Ditto enables LLMs to roleplay through self-alignment, eliminating the need for advanced models.
- LLMs are seen as a superposition of characters with inherent conversational styles and knowledge.
- Providing character profiles and attributes aligns LLMs to respond consistently in roleplay.
- Ditto is scalable and flexible, using 4,000 characters from Wikipedia for a large roleplay dataset.
- Evaluating roleplay is tricky; previous efforts relied on costly manual annotations.
- Ditto allows LLMs to automatically score roleplay, assessing role identity consistency and knowledge accuracy.
- Experiments show Ditto gives LLMs roleplay capabilities without mimicking advanced chatbots.
- Ditto-based models achieve high consistency in role identity, showing strong self-awareness.
- General performance of Ditto-based models matches advanced chatbots but falls short on accurate knowledge.
- Roleplay process benefits from imitation learning for consistent role identity but not for knowledge metrics.
- Knowledge in roleplay is limited by inherent capabilities of LLMs.
- Ditto separates character knowledge and conversation style, making it compatible with any instruction-following LLM.
- Ditto creates the first multilingual dataset with 4,000 roles, surpassing previous works.
- Self-alignment improves weaker language models by fine-tuning on outputs from stronger models.
- Model imitation fosters hallucination due to capability gaps between open and closed language models.
- LLMs acquire styles and knowledge of various roles during pre-training, enabling effective self-alignment.
- Roleplay requires LLMs to embody specific characters for immersive interaction.
- Ditto includes character knowledge collection, dialogue simulation, and supervised fine-tuning for roleplay alignment.
- Diverse characters and precise profiles are essential for generating high-quality role-play supervision.
- Ditto adapts to alternative knowledge bases and can extend to more complex multilingual scenarios.
- Dialogue simulation involves generating queries and responses relevant to the character's role.
- Objective metrics for evaluating roleplay include consistent role identity, accurate knowledge, and unknown question rejection.
- Experiments used various LLMs as seed models and generated training data from Wiki data and Wikipedia.
- Proprietary models generally outperform open-source models in roleplay capabilities.
- Roleplay expertise baselines have better self-awareness consistency and cognitive boundaries than general baselines.
- Ditto shows robust effectiveness on LLMs of different scales, achieving high scores in consistency and knowledge.
