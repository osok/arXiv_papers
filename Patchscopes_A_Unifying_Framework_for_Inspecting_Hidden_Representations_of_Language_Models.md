# SUMMARY
The text discusses the hidden layers of large language models (LLMs) and introduces a new interpretability framework called Patch Scopes, which translates LLM representations into human-readable text.

# IDEAS:
- Understanding hidden layers in LLMs is crucial for AI control.
- Existing methods to interpret hidden layers have limitations.
- Linear classifiers (probes) require supervised training for predefined classes.
- Projecting hidden representations into vocabulary space decreases accuracy in early layers.
- Intervening in computation provides class probabilities but lacks high-quality explanations.
- Patch Scopes is a modular framework for extracting information from LLM representations.
- Patch Scopes can decode specific information independently of the original context.
- Many existing methods can be cast as Patch Scopes.
- Patch Scopes introduce more effective tools and mitigate prior approach limitations.
- Patch Scopes enable fine-grained analysis of input contextualization.
- Patch Scopes can inspect hidden representations of smaller models using more expressive models.
- Experiments show Patch Scopes outperform vocabulary projection methods.
- Patch Scopes significantly outperform probing in common sense and factual reasoning tasks.
- Patch Scopes can verbalize the gradual entity resolution process in LLMs.
- Patch Scopes can fix latent multi-hop reasoning errors in LLMs.
- Activation patching is used for localizing specific information in LLMs.
- Patching has been used to study new problem setups in LLMs.
- Patch Scopes can decode features independent of the source prompt computation.
- Patch Scopes are not limited by the number of classes of the chosen feature.
- Cross-model patching improves expressiveness and output quality.
- Patch Scopes can enhance multi-hop reasoning performance without generating reasoning steps.

# INSIGHTS:
