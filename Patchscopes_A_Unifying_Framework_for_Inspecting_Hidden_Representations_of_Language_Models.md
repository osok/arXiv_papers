# SUMMARY
The text discusses the hidden layers of large language models (LLMs) and introduces a new interpretability framework called Patch Scopes, which leverages LLMs' text generation capabilities to decode information from their hidden representations.

# IDEAS:
- Hidden layers of LLMs store crucial information for understanding and controlling AI.
- Existing methods to interpret hidden layers have limitations, such as requiring supervised training.
- Probes use linear classifiers but struggle with many classes or unknown categories.
- Projecting hidden representations into vocabulary space decreases accuracy in early layers.
- Intervening in computation provides class probabilities but lacks high-quality natural language explanations.
- Patch Scopes is a modular framework to extract information from LLM representations.
- Patch Scopes decode specific information by patching it into a separate inference pass.
- Patch Scopes can be configured as inspection tools for particular objectives.
- Many existing methods can be cast as Patch Scopes.
- New configurations of Patch Scopes introduce more effective tools.
- Patch Scopes enable fine-grained analysis of input contextualization processes.
- Patch Scopes can inspect hidden representations of smaller models using more expressive models.
- Experiments show Patch Scopes outperform vocabulary projection methods in next token prediction.
- Patch Scopes significantly outperform probing in common sense and factual reasoning tasks.
- Patch Scopes can verbalize the gradual entity resolution process in LLMs.
- Using stronger target models improves Patch Scope expressivity.
- Patch Scopes can fix latent multi-hop reasoning errors in LLMs.
- Activation patching is a causal intervention for studying key activations in model computation.
- Patching localizes specific information to layers and token positions.
- Patch Scopes translate LLM representations into natural language.
- Patch Scopes encompass various interpretability methods like projecting representations to output vocabulary space.
- Changing the target prompt in Patch Scopes decodes any feature independent of the source prompt.
- Cross-model patching uses a more capable model to decode information from a less expressive model.
- Token identity patch scope outperforms other methods in early layers.
- Attribute extraction with Patch Scopes doesn't require training or predefined labels.
- Patch Scopes perform better than linear probes in capturing complex relations.
- Entity resolution analysis shows popular entities are easier to resolve than rare ones.
