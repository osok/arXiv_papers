# SUMMARY
The paper addresses limitations in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning, introducing the Program of Thought (PoT) framework and Program-Aided Language (PAL) models to enhance accuracy and reliability.

# IDEAS:
- The proposed method aims to solve LLMs' hallucination issue in numerical calculations.
- The Program of Thought (PoT) framework incorporates an external code interpreter.
- The method allows reassessment and alteration of solution paths upon encountering mistakes.
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm is integrated with LLMs for enhanced reasoning.
- The approach begins with pre-training an LLM as the policy model.
- An auxiliary linear layer is added for the value model, predicting values close to zero initially.
- MCTS tree samples solution paths for correct and incorrect final answers.
- Multitask loss function updates both policy and value models based on token prediction.
- Inference strategies include greedy decoding, step-level beam search, and MCTS.
- Step-level beam search generates actions based on the value LLM, reranking them iteratively.
- The value model assesses the correctness of intermediate steps, guiding subsequent reasoning.
- Q values for correct solutions skew towards one; incorrect solutions skew towards minus one.
- The method iteratively trains policy and value models using MCTS.
- Theoretical benefits include integration of value model with generative model for better evaluation.
- Practical benefits include autonomous generation of detailed solution processes without human annotations.
- The method showcases competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models.
- Iterative training strategy allows continuous improvement of policy and value models.
- Validation involves experiments on the math dataset, categorizing problems by difficulty and subject type.
- Performance increases with additional rounds of training across all inference strategies.
- The method demonstrates over 20 points enhancement for challenging problems in math datasets.
- Limitations include computational intensity and substantial resource demands of MCTS algorithm.
- Training data size is limited to 15K question-answer pairs without human annotations.
