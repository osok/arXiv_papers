# SUMMARY
The proposed long context Frontiers Loft Benchmark aims to solve the problem of inadequate evaluation of long context language models (LCLM) in deep learning.

# IDEAS:
- Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating LCLM on truly long context tasks useful in real-world applications.
- Loft introduces tasks spanning text, visual, and audio modalities with context lengths up to 1 million tokens.
- It focuses on areas where LCLM can disrupt traditional methods like retrieval and SQL-like reasoning.
- Loft allows rigorous evaluation of LCLM on complex tasks, stressing their performance on paradigm-shifting tasks.
- The benchmark consists of six tasks with 35 datasets, allowing automatic creation of increasing context lengths.
- Shared corpora for tasks like retrieval ensure fair comparison among models by mitigating causal attention effects.
- Corpus in context (CIC) prompting enables direct ingestion of large corpora within the context window.
- Loft promotes optimization of LCLM through techniques like CIC prompting, enhancing reasoning capabilities.
- State-of-the-art LCLM were evaluated against specialized models without task-specific fine-tuning.
- At the 128k token level, LCLM like Gemini and GPT-4.0 rival specialized models in textual retrieval tasks.
- LCLM outperform specialized models like CLIP in visual retrieval tasks across different benchmarks and context lengths.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro shows comparable performance to specialized models in audio retrieval tasks across multiple languages.
- In retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tasks, LCLM outperform RAG pipelines on multi-hop datasets.
- Closed book ablations reveal that removing the corpus from the context significantly lags behind long context models.
- LCLM show reasonable performance in SQL-like compositional reasoning tasks but lag behind specialized pipelines.
- Many-shot in-context learning evaluations show Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms GPT-4.0 on various benchmarks.
- Ablations over CIC prompt design demonstrate the effectiveness of task-specific instructions and shared corpora.
- The primary results show Gemini 1.5 Pro performed comparably to specialized models in text retrieval at 128k context length.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro outperformed GPT-4.0 across all visual benchmarks in text-to-image and text-to-video retrieval.
- In audio retrieval tasks, Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrated comparable performance to specialized models across multiple languages.
- Performance of LCLM declined when scaling the corpus to millions of tokens, indicating room for improvement.
- Limitations include reliance on synthetic tasks or fixed-length datasets that do not keep pace with evolving definitions.
- LCLM show lag in performance on complex multi-hop compositional reasoning tasks, indicating room for improvement.
- Large performance variance depending on prompting strategies like Chain of Thought reasoning is noted.
- Encoding a 1 million token context is slow and computationally expensive despite compatibility with prefix caching.
- Need for more challenging datasets in audio retrieval tasks to further push the capabilities of LCLM is indicated.
