# SUMMARY
The proposed long context Frontiers Loft Benchmark aims to solve the problem of inadequate evaluation of long context language models (LCLM) in deep learning. It introduces a suite of tasks across text, visual, and audio modalities with increasing context lengths up to 1 million tokens.

# IDEAS:
- Loft addresses inadequate evaluation of LCLM on truly long context tasks useful in real-world applications.
- Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic tasks or fixed-length datasets, not keeping pace with evolving long context definitions.
- Loft introduces tasks spanning text, visual, and audio modalities with context lengths up to 1 million tokens.
- It focuses on areas where LCLM can disrupt traditional methods like retrieval and SQL-like reasoning.
- Loft allows rigorous evaluation of LCLM on complex tasks, stressing their performance on paradigm-shifting tasks.
- The benchmark consists of six tasks with 35 datasets, allowing automatic creation of increasing context lengths.
- Shared corpora are constructed for tasks like retrieval and RAG, ensuring fair comparison among models.
- Corpus in Context (CIC) prompting enables direct ingestion of large corpora by LCLM within their context window.
- Loft promotes optimization of LCLM through techniques like CIC prompting, enhancing reasoning capabilities.
- State-of-the-art LCLM were evaluated against specialized models without task-specific fine-tuning.
- At the 128k token level, LCLM like Gemini and GPT-4 rival specialized models in textual retrieval tasks.
- LCLM outperform specialized models like CLIP in visual retrieval tasks across different benchmarks and context lengths.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates comparable performance to specialized models in audio retrieval tasks across multiple languages.
- In RAG tasks, LCLM like Gemini 1.5 Pro outperform RAG pipelines on multi-hop datasets.
- Closed book ablations reveal that removing the corpus from the context significantly lags behind long context models.
- LCLM show reasonable performance in SQL-like compositional reasoning tasks but lag behind specialized pipelines.
- Many-shot in-context learning evaluations show Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms GPT-4 on various benchmarks.
- Ablations over CIC prompt design demonstrate the effectiveness of task-specific instructions and shared corpora.
- The performance of LCLM declines when scaling the corpus to millions of tokens, indicating room for improvement.
- Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating LCLM on truly long context tasks useful in real-world applications.
- There is a large performance variance depending on prompting strategies like Chain of Thought reasoning.
- The efficiency of encoding a 1 million token context is slow and computationally expensive.
- The need for more challenging datasets in audio retrieval tasks is indicated to further push LCLM capabilities.
- LCLM show lower performance compared to specialized pipelines in SQL-like reasoning tasks.
- The study on CIC prompt ablations highlights the impact of different prompt design choices on performance.
