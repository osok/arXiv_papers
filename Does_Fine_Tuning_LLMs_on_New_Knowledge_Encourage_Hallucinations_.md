# SUMMARY
The study investigates how fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with new factual knowledge impacts their tendency to hallucinate. It introduces the SLICK framework to categorize knowledge and reveals that learning from unknown examples can degrade performance.

# IDEAS:
- Fine-tuning LLMs with new factual knowledge can lead to generating incorrect responses.
- SLICK categorizes examples as known or unknown, with subcategories for known examples.
- Learning from unknown examples slows down the model's integration of new knowledge.
- Fine-tuning on highly known examples alone does not yield the best results.
- Incorporating maybe known examples enhances the model's performance during testing.
- Unknown examples are fitted by the model at a slower rate compared to known examples.
- Filtering out unknown examples during fine-tuning reduces the risk of overfitting.
- Early stopping during fine-tuning typically yields the best performance.
- Unknown examples can be harmful, especially during longer training sessions.
- The model struggles to learn new information from unknown examples.
- Fine-tuning on maybe known examples is crucial for handling such cases accurately during inference.
- The SLICK classification system distinguishes between highly known, moderately known, weakly known, and unknown facts.
- Fine-tuning on unknown examples can lead to hallucinations on unrelated questions.
- The study suggests relabeling unknown examples with expressions of uncertainty.
- The Superficial Alignment Hypothesis suggests models primarily learn during pre-training.
- Fine-tuning may enhance the utilization of pre-existing knowledge rather than introducing new information.
- Capability misalignment occurs when fine-tuned LLMs face unfamiliar queries during testing.
- LLMs do not perform well when encountering new information in their input contexts.
- Quantifying knowledge in LLMs involves assessing agreement across multiple samples.
- A separate model, PIK, was trained to predict whether the LLM knows the answer to a question.
- SLICK categories provide meaningful and useful insights into a model's understanding.
