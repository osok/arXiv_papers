# SUMMARY
The study investigates how fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with new factual knowledge impacts their tendency to hallucinate. It introduces the SLICK framework to categorize knowledge and reveals that learning from unknown examples can degrade performance, while incorporating less certain facts enhances handling new information.

- Pre-training LLMs on textual data absorbs significant factual information.
- Fine-tuning aligns models with specific behaviors and human feedback.
- Fine-tuning introduces new factual information beyond pre-training knowledge.
- Exposure to new knowledge might lead to incorrect responses.
- SLICK framework categorizes knowledge based on model-generated answers.
- Known examples are divided into highly known, maybe known, and weakly known.
- Learning from unknown examples slows down model integration of new knowledge.
- Fine-tuning on known examples leads to better utilization of pre-existing knowledge.
- Filtering out unknown examples reduces overfitting without compromising performance.
- Incorporating maybe known examples is crucial for effective testing performance.
- Fine-tuning may enhance utilization of pre-existing knowledge rather than introducing new information.
- SLICK categorizes QA pairs based on model's ability to predict correct answers.
- Unknown category includes pairs where the model never predicts the correct answer.
- Known category is divided into highly known, maybe known, and weakly known.
- Higher percentage of unknown examples leads to performance degradation.
- Early stopping during fine-tuning typically yields the best performance.
- Training for more epochs usually reduces performance due to overfitting.
- Unknown examples are fitted by the model at a slower rate than known examples.
- Fitting unknown examples has a negative impact on performance.
- Fitting known examples has a positive impact on performance.
- Fine-tuning on unknown examples can lead to hallucinations on unrelated questions.
- Maybe known examples are essential for improving model performance without compromising highly known examples.
- SLICK classification system evaluates model's knowledge across four categories.
- Fine-tuning on unknown examples can lead to overfitting and incorrect information generation.
- Relabeling unknown examples with expressions of uncertainty could be more effective.
- Superficial alignment hypothesis suggests models primarily learn during pre-training.
- Fine-tuning on highly known examples does not always lead to optimal performance.
- Capability misalignment occurs when fine-tuned LLMs face unfamiliar queries during testing.
- LLMs do not perform well when encountering new information in input contexts.
