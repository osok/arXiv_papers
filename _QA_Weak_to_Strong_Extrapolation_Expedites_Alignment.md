# SUMMARY
The Expo method aims to improve the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences efficiently and scalably.

# IDEAS:
- Expo improves LLM alignment with human preference without additional training on existing models.
- It uses model interpolation and extrapolation to enhance alignment.
- Expo is quick to implement, requiring only a few lines of code.
- The method allows tuning a single hyperparameter, making it cost-effective.
- It leverages weights from two weaker models to create a stronger model.
- Expo can be applied across various LLM sizes and capabilities.
- The method amplifies the learned reward signal through extrapolation.
- Two prerequisites: model M should not be optimally trained, and weight change should indicate improved alignment.
- Expo enhances performance even with limited preference data.
- It avoids overfitting by focusing on amplifying the learned reward signal.
- The method shows promise in scaling up LLM improvements as base model capabilities increase.
- Expo is validated using the Alpaca Val 2.0 benchmark.
- Models trained with 10% data achieve competitive performance to fully trained models.
- Models trained with 20% data surpass fully trained models by 4%.
- Expo improves off-the-shelf DPO RLHF models by up to 6-8%.
- The method demonstrates scalability across model sizes from 7B to 70B.
- Limitations include the need for non-optimal training and quality of weight change.
- The choice of weaker models is crucial for Expo's success.
- Extrapolating from two SFT models trained from different bases can lead to model collapse.
- Training data size and hyperparameter configuration impact Expo's effectiveness.
