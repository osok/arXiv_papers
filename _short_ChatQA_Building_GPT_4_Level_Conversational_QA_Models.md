# SUMMARY
The paper proposes enhancing conversational QA by addressing follow-up questions and reducing hallucination, using a two-stage instruction tuning method for better retrieval and context-aware generation.

# IDEAS:
- Conversational QA enhances user experiences by addressing follow-up questions and reducing hallucination.
- This approach has become the standard for deploying QA models in production.
- Follow-up questions may lack sufficient information for retrieval in conversational QA.
- Training a dense retriever to retrieve top K relevant chunks given a single question is suggested.
- Previous solutions for conversational QA include query rewriting methods and generative models.
- A two-stage instruction tuning method improves generation with retrieval or provided context.
- Zero-shot evaluation and fine-tuning on a high-quality multi-turn data set are focused on.
- A straightforward approach yields comparable zero-shot results to state-of-the-art query rewriting models.
- Instruction tuning equips language models to follow natural language instructions.
- High-quality instruction tuning data sets are crucial for model development.
- A two-stage instruction tuning method enhances context-aware or retrieval-augmented generation.
- Supervised fine-tuning is applied on a blend of instruction-following and dialogue data sets.
- Context-enhanced instruction tuning improves the model's capability for context-aware generation.
- A large supervised fine-tuning set is constructed by combining multiple high-quality data sets.
- Contextualized QA data sets are integrated into the instruction tuning blend.
- Human-annotated and synthetic conversational QA data sets enhance the model's capability.
- Fine-tuning a single-turn retriever using conversational query and context pairs is proposed.
- Fine-tuning performs marginally worse than query rewriting in average top one recall.
- Fine-tuning achieves better results at average top five recall compared to query rewriting.
- Fine-tuning on high-quality conversational query context pairs performs on par with query rewriting methods.
- Fine-tuning avoids extra computational time and cost associated with autoregressive generation.

# INSIGHTS:
