# SUMMARY
The text discusses denoising diffusion models for synthetic image creation, focusing on classifier-free generation (CFG) and introducing a new method called Auto to improve image quality.

# IDEAS:
- Denoising diffusion models create synthetic images by gradually removing noise from an initial noisy image.
- A neural network acts as the denoiser, revealing the final image step by step.
- The denoising process can be mathematically represented as solving a differential equation.
- Classifier-free generation (CFG) focuses on generating images from high probability regions.
- CFG improves prompt alignment and image quality but has limitations like conditional generation restrictions.
- Auto separates image quality improvement from prompt alignment using a simplified version of the main model.
- Auto avoids task discrepancies and achieves better control over the generation process.
- Quantitative tests show significant improvements in generated image distributions with Auto.
- CFG enhances image quality by guiding image generation towards more realistic outcomes.
- An auxiliary denoiser refines the distribution marginalized over a class label in CFG.
- CFG helps align generated images with the desired class, preventing outliers and unrealistic samples.
- CFG eliminates outliers by pulling samples towards the core of the data manifold.
- The quality gap between denoiser networks affects the likelihood of a sample belonging to a specific class.
- Auto uses a lower quality model to guide a high-quality model, reducing errors in image synthesis.
- Synthetic degradations were introduced to test the compatibility of different models' degradations.
- Compatible degradations allow Auto to reverse damage caused by corruption in the base model.
- Auto significantly improved FID and fddi N O2 metrics in various tests.
- Independent exponential moving average (Emma) lengths for main and guiding models are beneficial.
- Reduced training time and capacity of the guiding model significantly affect FID metrics.
- Auto outperforms standard CFG in terms of FID and produces a wider range of image compositions.
- Combining both methods provides new artistic control for generating images.
