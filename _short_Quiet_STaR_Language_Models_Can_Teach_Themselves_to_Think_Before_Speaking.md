# SUMMARY
A novel text generation approach is presented, involving parallel rationale generation, mixing post-rationale and base predictions, and optimizing rationale generation.

# IDEAS:
- Parallel rationale generation uses a diagonal attention mask for efficient token position processing.
- Hidden thoughts are generated for each observed token, enabling highly parallel generation.
- Sampling one next token from each input token allows arbitrary repetition of the procedure.
- Computational efficiency is improved by caching each forward pass and concatenating attention masks.
- Mixing post-rationale and base predictions involves a mixing head to determine weight incorporation.
- A learned interpolation between language model predictions with and without thoughts is introduced.
- A shallow multi-layer perceptron outputs a scaler for each token in the mixing process.
- The process helps ease distribution shift early and fine-tuning by incorporating rationales.
- Reinforce provides a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future token prediction.
- Teacher forcing trick includes the likelihood of predicting later tokens in the loss function.
- Rationale generation parameters are optimized to increase the likelihood of generating rationales.
- The likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens is included.
- The aim is to reduce variance in training and improve the overall quality of generated text.
- Diagonal attention masks allow for parallel processing of token positions in the input sequence.
- Caching forward passes and concatenating attention masks enhance computational efficiency.
- Mixing head determines the weight for incorporating post-rationale predicted logits.
- Shallow multi-layer perceptron aids in smoothing transition to thinking by learned interpolation.
- Reinforce learning signal optimizes rationale generation based on future token prediction impact.
- Teacher forcing trick reduces variance in training by including later token prediction likelihood.
