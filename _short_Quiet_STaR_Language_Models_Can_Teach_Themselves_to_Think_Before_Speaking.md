# SUMMARY
A novel text generation approach is presented, involving parallel rationale generation, mixing post-rationale and base predictions, and optimizing rationale generation.

# IDEAS:
- Parallel rationale generation focuses on efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence.
- Diagonal attention mask allows for highly parallel generation by generating hidden thoughts for each observed token.
- Sampling one next token from each token in the input sequence enables arbitrary repetition of the procedure.
- Computational efficiency is improved through caching each forward pass and concatenating a diagonal attention mask.
- Mixing post-rationale and base predictions involves a mixing head determining the weight for incorporating post-rational logits.
- A learned interpolation between language model predictions with and without thoughts smooths the transition to thinking.
- A shallow multi-layer perceptron is used for the mixing head, outputting a scaler for each token.
- The process helps ease distribution shift early and fine-tuning by incorporating rationales.
- Optimizing rationale generation employs reinforce to provide a learning signal based on their impact on future token prediction.
- Teacher forcing trick includes the likelihood of predicting later tokens in the loss function.
- Rationale generation parameters such as start, end tokens, and language model weights are optimized.
- The goal is to increase the likelihood of generating rationales that make future text more probable.
- Including the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens reduces variance in training.
- The overall quality of generated text is improved by optimizing rationale generation.
- The method involves three key steps: parallel rationale generation, mixing post-rationale and base predictions, and optimizing rationale generation.
- Diagonal attention mask and caching improve computational efficiency in parallel rationale generation.
- Mixing head uses a shallow multi-layer perceptron to output a scaler for each token.
- Reinforce provides a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future token prediction.
- Teacher forcing trick helps include the likelihood of predicting later tokens in the loss function.
