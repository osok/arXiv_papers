# SUMMARY
The paper addresses the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their struggle to locate relevant documents placed mid-input. It proposes an attention calibration mechanism to mitigate positional attention bias, improving model performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks.
