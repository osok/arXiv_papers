# SUMMARY
The authors introduce V Mamba, a novel visual foundation model for efficient visual representation learning. V Mamba uses a visual state space model (VSSM) inspired by the Selective Scan Space State Sequential Model (S6) to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to linear. The Cross Scan Module (CSM) addresses direction-sensitive problems, enabling global receptive fields without increasing computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate V Mamba's effectiveness across various visual tasks, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs.
