- Multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules add or remove information.
- Demonstration examples are concatenated with a test query to predict responses.
- Context injection integrates context information with query activations using linear operations.
- Noisy self-calibration estimates linear coefficients using a gradient-based approach.
- Random Gaussian noises during calibration enhance adaptability to downstream variations.
- Calibration only needs to be done once per task.
- I2 outperforms other techniques like noise vector, soft prompt, label anchor, and task vector.
- Context vector captures abstract and generic concepts resilient to token space variations.
