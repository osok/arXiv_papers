# SUMMARY
The text discusses the introduction of the attention-driven training-free efficient diffusion model (atEDM) framework, which accelerates diffusion model (DM) inference without retraining by dynamically pruning redundant tokens using the generalized weighted page rank (GWPR) algorithm and a denoising steps aware pruning (DSAP) schedule.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models (DMs) have transformed computer vision but require significant computational resources.
- Latent diffusion models (LDMs) make text-to-image generation more accessible but are still slow.
- Efficient sampling methods reduce denoising steps but don't address memory and compute costs.
- Efficient architectures lower the cost of each step and can be combined with sampling strategies.
- Most efficient architecture methods need retraining, which is time-consuming and costly.
- The attention-driven training-free efficient diffusion model (atEDM) framework speeds up DM inference without retraining.
- atEDM leverages attention maps to accelerate pre-trained DMs.
- Token pruning for denoising steps uses a graph-based algorithm called generalized weighted page rank (GWPR).
- A novel token recovery method maintains image quality after pruning.
- Attention map variances across denoising steps are analyzed to propose a pruning schedule.
- The denoising steps aware pruning (DSAP) schedule adjusts pruning ratios to improve efficiency.
- atEDM applied to the SDXL model achieves state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.
- atEDM generates clearer images with sharper details and better text-image alignment.
- The token pruning scheme involves obtaining attention maps and assigning importance to tokens.
- Pruning masks are generated based on calculated importance distribution.
- Pruned tokens are filled before passing to the ResNet block using a similarity-based copy technique.
- DSAP prunes fewer tokens in early denoising steps for better image quality.
- Early denoising steps shape the image layout, while late steps refine it.
- DSAP avoids pruning the first attention block in each down stage and the last in each up stage.
- Experiments show that DSAP outperforms aggressive pruning schedules in early denoising steps.
- atEDM incorporates a pruning layer after the first attention layer of each attention block.
- The pruning ratio is set to 63% to meet the computational budget.
- DSAP strategy improves image quality and text-image alignment in both atEDM and other methods.
- Quantitative evaluations show atEDM reduces FID scores and improves CLIP scores compared to other methods.
- atEDM achieves lower FID scores than the full-size model while reducing flops by 32.8%.
- Latency analysis reveals that atEDM achieves notable speed-ups with minimal quality loss.
- Self-attention-based GWPR outperforms cross-attention-based GWPR in image quality enhancement.

# INSIGHTS:
- Efficient architectures combined with sampling strategies can significantly reduce computational costs in DMs.
- Token pruning using GWPR algorithm effectively identifies and removes redundant tokens in attention maps.
- DSAP schedule optimizes pruning ratios across denoising steps, enhancing both efficiency and image quality.
- Early denoising steps are crucial for shaping image layout, while late steps refine details.
- Avoiding pruning in specific attention blocks during early denoising steps improves overall image quality.
