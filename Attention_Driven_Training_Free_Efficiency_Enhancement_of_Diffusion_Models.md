# SUMMARY
The text discusses the development of the attention-driven training-free efficient diffusion model (atEDM) to accelerate diffusion models (DMs) in computer vision, focusing on token pruning and denoising steps.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models (DMs) have transformed computer vision tasks but are computationally expensive.
- Latent diffusion models (LDMs) make text-to-image generation more accessible but remain slow.
- Efficient sampling methods reduce denoising steps but don't address memory and compute costs.
- Efficient architectures lower the cost of each step and can be combined with sampling strategies.
- Most efficient architecture methods need retraining, which is time-consuming and costly.
- The attention-driven training-free efficient diffusion model (atEDM) speeds up DM inference without retraining.
- atEDM leverages attention maps for token pruning during denoising steps.
- The generalized weighted page rank (GWPR) algorithm identifies unnecessary tokens in attention maps.
- A novel token recovery method maintains image quality after pruning.
- The denoising steps aware pruning (DSAP) schedule adjusts pruning ratios across denoising steps.
- atEDM applied to the SDXL model achieves state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.
- atEDM generates clearer images with sharper details and better text-image alignment.
- The UNet attention block is a major contributor to the workload in generating images.
- Token pruning involves extracting attention maps and assigning importance values to tokens.
- Pruning masks are created based on the importance distribution of tokens.
- Pruned tokens are filled in before passing to the ResNet block using similarity-based copying.
- DSAP prunes fewer tokens in early denoising steps for better image quality.
- Early denoising steps are less informative and more chaotic compared to later steps.
- DSAP leaves specific attention blocks unpruned in early denoising steps.
- Experiments show that DSAP outperforms aggressive pruning schedules in early denoising steps.
- atEDM incorporates a pruning layer after the first attention layer of each attention block.
- The pruning ratio is set to 63% to meet the computational budget.
- Visual and quantitative evaluations show atEDM outperforms existing methods like ToMe.
- atEDM achieves lower FID scores and better CLIP scores compared to ToMe.
- atEDM reduces FID difference from 8.0 to 0.7 under certain conditions.
- atEDM consistently outperforms ToMe in image quality across various FLOPs budgets.
- atEDM achieves notable speed-ups in latency without significant quality loss.
- Self-attention-based GWPR outperforms cross-attention-based GWPR in image quality enhancement.

# INSIGHTS:
- Efficient architectures combined with sampling strategies can significantly reduce computational costs.
- Token pruning and recovery methods are crucial for maintaining image quality in diffusion models.
- Early denoising steps play a critical role in shaping generated images, requiring careful pruning strategies.
- The DSAP schedule optimizes pruning by leaving specific attention blocks unpruned in early steps.
- Attention-driven training-free methods can accelerate pre-trained models without retraining.
