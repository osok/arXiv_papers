# SUMMARY

The text explores uncertainty quantification in language models (LMs), distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. It introduces methods to handle multi-response queries, including an information-theoretic metric, a computable lower bound, and a hallucination detection algorithm.

# IDEAS

- Epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge about the ground truth.
- Aleatoric uncertainty stems from inherent randomness in the prediction process.
- Iterative prompting can assess the level of epistemic uncertainty in LMs.
- An information-theoretic metric quantifies epistemic uncertainty in language models.
- A computable lower bound for this metric is akin to mutual information.
- An algorithm detects hallucinated responses using a mutual information estimator.
- The method shows superior performance on various question-answering datasets.
- Prompt composition plays a crucial role in determining the model's response.
- Repeating incorrect responses in prompts affects the probability of correct responses.
- The entropy of a distribution is the sum of probabilities times the logarithm of inverse probabilities.
- KL Divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions.
- Mutual information measures the uncertainty in our knowledge.
- A pseudo joint distribution represents the distribution of responses given a query.
- The hallucination metric indicates how much the LM deviates from the ground truth.
- A lower bound for KL Divergence depends on the pseudo joint distribution.
- The query conditional excess risk involves controlling errors in learning algorithms.
- Estimating mutual information involves evaluating a distribution on its entire range.
- An empirical distribution based on a finite sample controls estimation error.
- The expected missing mass influences the rate of estimation error.
- Score-based hallucination tests help decide if an LM is hallucinating or valid.
- Calibration on a separate dataset fine-tunes the threshold parameter for hallucination detection.
- Different scoring functions include greedy response probability and response entropy estimate.
- The proposed method performs well on single-label and multi-label queries with higher entropy.
- Combining diverse query types validates the method's effectiveness in varied scenarios.
- Calibration and threshold optimization improve performance on challenging datasets.
