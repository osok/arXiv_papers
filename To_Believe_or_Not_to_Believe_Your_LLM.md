# SUMMARY

The text explores uncertainty quantification in language models (LMs), distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. It introduces methods to handle multi-response queries, proposes an information-theoretic metric for epistemic uncertainty, and develops a hallucination detection algorithm. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated on various question-answering datasets.
