# SUMMARY
A new framework called AGILE for large language model (LLM) agents is introduced, combining modules like memory, tools, and executor to enhance learning and operation. The framework uses reinforcement learning and a new skill called "seeking advice" to improve performance, evaluated through Product QA and Med MC QA benchmarks.

# IDEAS:
- AGILE framework combines LLM, memory, tools, and executor to enhance learning and operation processes.
- The executor interprets LLM instructions and coordinates the modules to carry out actions.
- A new skill called "seeking advice" allows agents to consult experts and learn from feedback.
- Reinforcement learning trains the agent to use different modules and improve reasoning, planning, reflection, and seeking advice abilities.
- Product QA benchmark assesses the agent's ability to handle information, use tools, interact with humans, self-evaluate, and reflect.
- AGILE agents trained with reinforcement learning outperform existing LLM agents like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- The framework allows interaction with human experts by predicting function names that the executor executes.
- Policy learning is framed as training a language model, deriving training sequences from agent trajectories.
- The agent can request correct answers when unsure and distill general knowledge from expert advice.
- The decision-making process for seeking advice aligns with the RL framework, considering resource costs as RL rewards.
- Product QA data set includes 26 QA tasks focusing on specific product groups within a category.
- Questions are categorized into fact QA, search QA, and reasoning QA types.
- The agent can perform functions like prompting the user for questions, retrieving relevant information, and deciding whether to predict an answer or seek human advice.
- Training involves imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning for further optimization.
- Evaluation metrics include advice rate, accuracy, and total score.
- AGILE agents surpass baselines in Product QA, showing significant improvements in accuracy and total score.
- Ablation studies highlight the importance of individual agent components like memory, reflection, and tool use.
- RL training enhances the agent's performance by reducing advice-seeking rate and improving accuracy.
- Med MC QA results show AGILE agents achieving high accuracy with effective use of advice-seeking.
- Human-agent interaction challenges like hallucination and limited longtail knowledge can be addressed by involving human experts.
- Existing benchmarks do not comprehensively address all real-world agent application challenges.

# INSIGHTS:
- Combining LLM, memory, tools, and executor enhances agent learning and operation processes.
- Seeking advice from experts significantly improves agent performance and adaptability.
- Reinforcement learning optimizes agent skills collectively within an RL framework.
- Product QA benchmark provides a comprehensive evaluation of agent capabilities in real-world scenarios.
- AGILE agents outperform existing LLM agents by integrating multiple modules and seeking expert advice.
- Decision-making for seeking advice should align with the agent's knowledge and capabilities.
- Human experts help address challenges like hallucination and limited longtail knowledge in LLMs.
- Effective use of memory, reflection, and tool use is crucial for high-performing agents.
- RL training reduces human costs by decreasing the advice-seeking rate over time.
