# SUMMARY
A novel framework for large language model (LLM) agents called Agile is introduced, combining planning, reflection, tool use, and lifelong learning to enhance performance.

# IDEAS:
- Agile framework consists of four modules: LLM, memory, tools, and executor.
- The LLM predicts actions while the executor carries out these actions.
- A new skill called "seeking advice" allows the agent to consult experts.
- Training method based on reinforcement learning improves reasoning, planning, and reflection.
- Product QA benchmark evaluates the agent's ability to handle information and interact with humans.
- Agile agents outperform existing LLM agents like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- The state of the agent includes context and memory pair.
- The action space corresponds to the vocabulary of the LLM.
- The executor uses predefined logic to transition states.
- The environment provides a reward based on the current state and action taken.
- The agent can request correct answers when unsure through "seek advice."
- Decision-making for seeking advice aligns with the RL framework.
- Product QA dataset includes 26 QA tasks focusing on specific product groups.
- Questions are categorized into fact QA, search QA, and reasoning QA types.
- Training involves imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning optimization.
- Evaluation metrics include advice rate, accuracy, and total score.
- Agile agents show a significant improvement in accuracy and total score.
- Ablation studies highlight the importance of individual agent components.
- RL training enhances the agent's policy and reduces advice-seeking rate.
- Med MC QA dataset focuses on multiple-choice questions from medical exams.
- Agile agents achieve high accuracy and reduced human costs through RL training.

# INSIGHTS:
- Combining planning, reflection, tool use, and lifelong learning enhances LLM agent performance.
- Seeking advice from experts significantly improves the agent's accuracy and adaptability.
- Reinforcement learning optimizes decision-making skills in an end-to-end manner.
- Product QA benchmark comprehensively evaluates complex question-answering abilities.
- Memory and reflection capabilities are crucial for reducing advice-seeking frequency.
- Adaptive decision-making is essential for effective human-agent interaction.
- RL training reduces human costs by improving agent independence and knowledge accumulation.
- Integrating human experts helps address hallucination and limited longtail knowledge issues.
- Confidence measures must align with the LLM's knowledge and capabilities for effective advice-seeking.
- Comprehensive benchmarks are needed to evaluate real-world agent applications.
