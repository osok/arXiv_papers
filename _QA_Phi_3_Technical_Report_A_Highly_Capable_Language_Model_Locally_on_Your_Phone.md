# SUMMARY
The F3 Mini model, developed to rival larger models like GPT-3.5, focuses on data quality and efficiency for local inference on modern phones.

# IDEAS:
- F3 Mini aims to match larger models' performance while being small enough for local phone inference.
- The model uses LLM-based filtering of web data and synthetic data for training.
- F3 Mini was quantized to 4 bits to reduce memory usage, enabling efficient phone deployment.
- The model's architecture is a Transformer decoder with a default context length of 4K.
- A long context version, F3 Mini 128K, extends the context length to 128K.
- Built on a similar block structure as Llama 2, it uses the same tokenizer.
- The model has 372 hidden dimensions, 32 heads, and 32 layers.
- Trained using B float 16 for a total of 3T tokens.
- Training data includes heavily filtered web data and synthetic LLM-generated data.
- Phase one of training focuses on general knowledge and language understanding.
- Phase two merges filtered web data with synthetic data for logical reasoning and niche skills.
- Post-training includes supervised instruction fine-tuning and preference tuning with DPO.
- Evaluations ensure alignment with Microsoft's responsible AI principles.
- The model undergoes red teaming and automated testing to reduce harmful response rates.
- Evaluated on standard open-source benchmarks for reasoning ability.
- Safety benchmarks assess responses in terms of groundedness and harmfulness.
- Despite its capabilities, the model has limitations in factual knowledge storage and language restrictions.
- The model achieves more than 12 tokens per second when running natively on an iPhone 14.
- The training methodology focuses on high-quality data rather than sheer scale.
- F3 Mini can be easily inferenced locally on a modern phone.
- The model's post-training processes ensure safety, robustness, and ethical alignment.
- Limitations include lower performance on trivia QA tasks due to size constraints.
- Challenges like factual inaccuracies, biases, and inappropriate content generation persist.
- Continuous development and refinement are crucial to enhance performance and mitigate risks.
