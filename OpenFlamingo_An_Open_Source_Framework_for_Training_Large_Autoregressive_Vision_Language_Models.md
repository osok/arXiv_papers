# SUMMARY
The introduction discusses the limitations of existing Vision language models that only take a single image's input and are closed source which hinders research on their performance and safety. The authors present open Flamingo, an open-source reproduction of the Flamingo models, which allows for an arbitrarily interleaved sequence of images and text as input. The open Flamingo models, ranging from 3B to 9B parameters, achieve 85 to 89 percent of the performance of the corresponding Flamingo models on various evaluation datasets.

# IDEAS:
- Vision language models typically take an image and text as input to generate text.
- Auto-regressive Vision language models handle sequences of images and text, offering more flexibility.
- Models like Flamingo, CM3, Cosmos 1, PALME, and multimodal GPT-4 perform well but are closed source.
- Open Flamingo is an open-source version of Flamingo, trained on web-scraped image-text sequences.
- Open Flamingo models range from 3 billion to 9 billion parameters.
- Open Flamingo achieved 85-89% of the performance of corresponding Flamingo models.
- Generative Vision language models generate text based on sequences of images and text.
- Flamingo model's performance improves consistently with up to 32 examples.
- Open Flamingo uses open-source datasets like LAION2B and multimodal C4.
- Cross-attention links text to corresponding images in Open Flamingo.
- Open Flamingo models predict the next text token based on previous tokens and the last image.
- Training data includes image-text pairs and interleaved sequences from LAION2B and MMC4.
- Synthetic data generated by ChatGPT was also used for training.
- Training involved predicting the next token in a sequence using AdamW optimization.
- Distributed training was conducted using 64 GPUs across eight nodes.
- Evaluation was done on seven Vision language datasets including captioning and visual question answering.
- Open Flamingo models perform well compared to Flamingo but underperform in certain datasets like OKVQA.
- Performance generally improves with more in-context examples but at a slower rate than Flamingo models.
- Instruction-tuned variants of language models generally outperform base models.
- Frozen embeddings in some models led to decreased performance.
- Open Flamingo models struggle with counting and tend to be verbose in answers.
- Applications include Otter, a multimodal assistant, and Multimodal GPT.
- Open Flamingo models carry risks due to training on web-scraped data without safety-focused fine-tuning.
