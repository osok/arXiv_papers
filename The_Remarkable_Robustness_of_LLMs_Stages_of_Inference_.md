- Networks exhibit self-repair and redundancy, supporting iterative inference processes.
- Specific roles for attention heads and neurons form complex circuits in LLMs.
- Layer deletion and swapping experiments reveal the importance of different network depths.
- First and last layers play crucial roles in model performance; middle layers are more resilient.
- Residual connections in Transformer models enable ensemble formation of shallow computational sub-networks.
- Residual connections reduce reliance on individual paths, enhancing resilience to interventions.
- Tokenization stage transforms raw token representations into coherent entities.
- Feature engineering stage constructs valuable features for predicting future tokens.
- Prediction ensembling stage translates semantic features into concrete next-token predictions.
- Residual sharpening stage involves suppression neurons refining final token predictions.
- GPT2 models show greater robustness than Pythia models due to training factors.
- Pruning or quantizing models can reveal depth-related insights and improve performance.
- Token frequency dependencies in MLP weights provide valuable robustness insights.
- Swapping adjacent layers is less harmful than ablating layers, indicating commutative operations.
- Early layer attention heads focus more on nearby tokens than later attention heads.
- Prediction neurons become more prominent towards latter layers, crucial for predictions.
- Suppression neurons inhibit predictions, adjusting confidence in final predictions.
- Final layers have the highest density of suppression neurons, refining predictions.
- Removing or changing the final layer leads to model breakdown, similar to initial layers.
- Subjoin heads construct multi-token words, aiding tokenization and feature engineering stages.
- Collaboration between prediction and suppression neurons outperforms individual neurons.
