- Understanding and controlling model failures is crucial as their capabilities expand.
- Techniques like reinforcement learning and automated red teaming shape model behavior.
- Combining reinforcement learning with automated red teaming generates high-quality datasets.
- Building powerful reward models describes complex natural language concepts like correctness or safety.
- Significant gaps remain in understanding model failures despite improved techniques.
- Defining alignment for models is practically impossible and may require complex solutions.
- Focusing on arithmetic questions avoids defining complex alignment concepts.
- Solving arithmetic problems exposes the complexity of natural language.
- A new test bed explores alignment techniques, attacks, and mitigations.
- An algorithm generates adversarial attacks that transfer across model families.
- Performance changes during training are analyzed, including out-of-distribution model attacks.
- Mitigation strategies for agentic loops allow models to revise their answers.
- Complete elimination of vulnerabilities in models is not possible.
- Language models can capture human preferences with minimal human inputs.
- Adversarial attacks on neural networks are extensively studied in computer vision models.
- Attacking language models is challenging due to discrete input space and non-differentiable output sampling.
- Black box methods can elicit outputs violating language model behavior constraints.
- Research into reducing copeny may reduce adversarial attack surfaces.
- The search method finds ways to exploit a model without white box access.
- Two mitigation strategies: strengthening the model using AI feedback and allowing model response revision.
- Prompt inversion rejection sampling generates attacks by steering a model to produce undesired outputs.
- Attack success depends on model size, error magnitude, and targeted error size.
- Larger models do not necessarily become more robust against attacks.
- Steering a model towards a specific wrong answer is almost as easy as general misbehavior.
- Adversarial hardening improves model resilience against attacks.
- Training on semantically rich corruptions of data improves robustness.
- Evaluation metrics include sequence copying, random templating, procedural word problems, and out-of-distribution attacks.
- Context overload attack involves repeating false equations within a given context.
- Hardened models resist false information until thousands of copies are present in the context.
- Agentic mitigations involve another model revising the first model's output based on overriding instructions.
