# SUMMARY
The discussion centers on the rise of large language models (LLMs) like GPT and PaLM, their applications, and the challenges in efficiently serving them. The authors propose "paged attention," an algorithm inspired by virtual memory paging, to improve memory management and throughput in LLM serving systems. They introduce vLLM, a distributed LLM serving engine that significantly enhances throughput without compromising model accuracy.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT and PaLM have enabled new applications such as programming assistance.
- Running LLM applications is expensive due to the need for hardware accelerators like GPUs.
- The auto-regressive Transformer model at the core of LLMs generates words one at a time.
- This sequential generation process makes the workload memory-bound, limiting serving throughput.
- Paged attention divides the request's key-value cache into blocks for more efficient memory management.
- vLLM, built on top of paged attention, achieves near-zero waste in KV cache memory.
- vLLM supports popular LLMs such as GPT, OPT, and LLaMA with varying sizes.
- Evaluations show vLLM improves LLM serving throughput by two to four times compared to state-of-the-art systems.
- Transformers are the go-to architecture for modeling probabilities on a large scale.
- The self-attention layer in Transformers calculates attention scores by multiplying query vectors with key vectors.
- LLMs generate new tokens sequentially, with each token's generation depending on all previous tokens.
- Fine-grained batching mechanisms like cellular batching and iteration-level scheduling increase LLM serving throughput.
- Memory management in LLM serving systems faces challenges such as large KV cache sizes and complex decoding algorithms.
- Paged attention allows for storing continuous keys and values in non-contiguous memory space.
- vLLM's memory manager operates similarly to virtual memory in operating systems.
- vLLM dynamically assigns physical blocks to logical blocks, allowing for effective memory utilization.
- vLLM supports various decoding scenarios such as parallel sampling and beam search.
- Scheduling and preemption are crucial when request traffic exceeds the system's capacity.
- vLLM adopts a first-come, first-serve scheduling policy to ensure fairness and prevent starvation.
- In distributed execution, vLLM supports model parallelism with a centralized scheduler.
- Kernel-level optimizations improve memory access patterns and support variable sequence lengths.
- vLLM can handle higher request rates compared to Orca and Faster Transformer while maintaining similar latencies.
- Memory sharing in paged attention shows significant performance benefits in parallel sampling and beam search.
- vLLM achieves higher throughput in scenarios where a prefix is shared among different input prompts.
- The performance of vLLM is evaluated using OPT models with different parameters and workloads synthesized from real LLM services.
- The serving throughput measured by normalized latency is the key metric for evaluation.
- The dynamic block mapping in paged attention impacts the performance of GPU operations involving the stored KV cache.
- Block size significantly affects the performance of vLLM, with smaller block sizes avoiding significant internal fragmentation.
- Recomputation is more efficient than swapping when the block size is small.

# INSIGHTS:
- Paged attention enables efficient memory management by dividing KV cache into blocks stored non-contiguously.
- Fine-grained batching mechanisms significantly increase LLM serving throughput by reducing delays and inefficiencies.
- Dynamic block mapping in paged attention allows for flexible memory management, improving overall system performance.
- Memory sharing in paged attention shows substantial benefits in complex decoding scenarios like beam search.
- Scheduling and preemption policies are crucial for managing high request traffic in LLM serving systems.
- Kernel-level optimizations are essential for supporting variable sequence lengths and improving memory access patterns.
- Recomputation is more efficient than swapping for small block sizes due to lower data transfer overheads.
