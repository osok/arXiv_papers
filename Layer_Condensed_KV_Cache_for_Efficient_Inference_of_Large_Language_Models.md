# SUMMARY
A novel approach to reduce memory consumption in large language models by focusing on the key-value (KV) cache, reducing layers instead of sequence length.

# IDEAS:
- Reducing the number of layers in the KV cache saves memory without computational overhead.
- Pairing queries from all layers with keys and values from the top layer.
- The top layer holds the most informative content in Transformer layers.
- Combining the new approach with standard attention for a few layers maintains performance.
- Introducing a parallel training method to support larger batch sizes and higher throughput.
- Sequential dependencies between tokens pose a challenge for training.
- Using gradient stopping to backpropagate loss through fewer iterations reduces memory usage.
- Fast convergence of KVs allows approximation with fewer iterations.
- Iterative computation for prompts is fast, minimizing extra time spent on encoding.
- The method shows significant memory reduction and improved throughput in experiments.
- The approach works well with other memory-saving techniques like streaming LLM.
- Integration with streaming LLM achieves lower latency and memory usage.
- Warm-up layers in a sandwich configuration yield the best performance results.
- A tradeoff exists between the number of warm-up layers and throughput.
- The method can handle inputs containing millions of tokens with stable performance.
- The new approach complements existing methods for KV cache reduction.
- The model achieves competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks.
- The method allows for larger batch sizes compared to standard Llama models.
- Throughput does not necessarily increase with maximum batch size due to compute-bound operations.
- The inference speedup justifies the longer training time compared to Tiny Llama.
