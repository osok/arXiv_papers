# SUMMARY
The text discusses advancements in transformer-based architectures, particularly in planning and reasoning tasks. It introduces "search former," a model that outperforms traditional algorithms like A* search in complex tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Transformer-based architectures have advanced in human-like conversations, image understanding, video generation, and code completion.
- Large language models (LLMs) excel in real-world applications due to vast data training.
- Transformers struggle with multi-step planning and complex reasoning tasks.
- Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) simulate human thought processes.
- CoT outlines reasoning steps; ToT explores different reasoning paths before selecting the best one.
- Search former is designed to compute optimal plans in fewer steps than traditional algorithms.
- Training involves mimicking A* search using synthetic datasets from random planning tasks.
- Execution traces of A* are logged as token sequences for training data.
- Search augmented sequences include A* execution traces, enhancing model performance.
- Models trained on search augmented sequences learn correct search dynamics better.
- Increasing parameters in solution-only models doesn't necessarily improve performance.
- Search former solves 93.7% of test tasks with 26.8% fewer search steps than A*.
- Search former uses a general transformer architecture with long contexts and positional embeddings.
- Search former can manage longer search execution traces than MCTS net.
- Training involves generating unique planning tasks and token sequences for each task.
- Non-deterministic A* introduces variability in execution trace lengths.
- Fine-tuning on shorter sequences reduces search steps during inference.
- Search former discovers new methods for solving planning problems efficiently.
- Evaluation criteria include exact match, any optimal 64, and success weighted by cost (s swc).
- Search augmented models outperform solution-only models, especially with limited training data.
- Bootstrapping process iteratively fine-tunes models on increasingly concise datasets.
- Search former generates shorter search sequences, leading to more efficient planning.
