# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the use of sparsely activated models to reduce computational cost and improve specialization in large neural networks derived from the Transformer architecture. The authors propose a non-uniform architecture with sparsity and a sparsely gated feed-forward layer coupled with different gating mechanisms to achieve near-perfect log-scale scaling in quality. They also introduce a blockwise sub-layer grouping for ease of scaling, which has proven effective in their evaluation at multiple model scales.
