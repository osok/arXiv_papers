# SUMMARY
The text discusses a new method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for solving math problems using machine learning. ReFT combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve model generalization and performance.

# IDEAS:
- ReFT uses reinforcement learning to solve math problems, improving over traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations act as roadmaps for solving math problems.
- Multiple valid CoT annotations can exist for the same question, enhancing model generalization.
- ReFT starts with a warm-up stage of SFT before using reinforcement learning.
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is the RL algorithm used in ReFT.
- ReFT samples multiple correct reasoning paths and learns from them.
- ReFT does not require a separate reward model, unlike other methods.
- ReFT achieves better performance without needing extra training questions.
- Experiments were conducted using foundational models like Code Llama and Galactica.
- ReFT benefits from majority voting and reward model reranking at inference time.
- Python programs as CoT prompts provide more accurate reasoning steps.
- ReFT focuses on both natural language CoT (NCoT) and program-based CoT (PCoT).
- The warm-up stage helps the model develop basic problem-solving skills.
- The RL stage improves performance through self-learning and sampling responses.
- The reward function compares the generated answer with the correct answer.
- Partial rewards can be given for numeric answers to reduce sparse reward impact.
- Offline self-training involves sampling data from the initial policy for fine-tuning.
- Online self-training continually trains with real-time generated samples.
- ReFT outperforms SFT and self-training methods across various datasets.
- Incorrect instances are crucial for guiding the model towards better exploration.
- Reward hacking can mislead the model during training on certain datasets.
- ReFT benefits from common techniques like majority voting and reranking.
- Smaller language models also show improved performance with ReFT.
- Partial rewards help mitigate the effect of sparse rewards during training.
- ReFT demonstrates robustness and effectiveness across different settings.
