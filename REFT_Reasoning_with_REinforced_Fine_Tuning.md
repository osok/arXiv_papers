# SUMMARY
A new method called reinforced fine-tuning (REF) is introduced to solve math problems using machine learning, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).

# IDEAS:
- REF uses reinforcement learning to sample multiple correct reasoning paths for math problems.
- REF starts with a warm-up stage of supervised fine-tuning for one or two cycles.
- Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is used in REF for online reinforcement learning.
- REF does not require a separate reward model, unlike other methods.
- REF achieves better generalization abilities than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- REF performs better than SFT using the same training questions without extra data.
- REF benefits from majority voting and reward model reranking at inference time.
- REF uses both natural language and program-based Chain of Thought (COT) annotations.
- REF's policy model improves by sampling responses and evaluating their correctness.
- The reward function in REF gives a score of zero for non-terminal states.
- REF uses the generalized advantage estimate for advantage calculation.
- The unified loss function in REF is the weighted sum of policy and value objectives.
- REF was tested on three math problem datasets: GSM 8K, SVM, and Math QA.
- REF consistently outperforms SFT and self-training methods across various datasets.
- Offline self-training can sometimes improve performance compared to SFT.
- Incorrect instances are crucial for guiding the model towards better exploration in REF.
- REF struggled with reward hacking during training on Math QA.
- Partial rewards help reduce the effect of sparse rewards during training in REF.
- REF demonstrates robustness even with smaller language models.
- The stable KL Divergence in REF suggests suitable program exploration.
- All versions of REF significantly outperform SFT after the 30th training cycle.
