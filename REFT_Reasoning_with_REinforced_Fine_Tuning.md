# SUMMARY
The text discusses a new method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for solving math problems using machine learning. ReFT combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve model generalization and performance.

# IDEAS:
- ReFT uses reinforcement learning to solve math problems, improving over traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations act as roadmaps for solving math problems.
- Multiple valid CoT annotations can exist for the same question, enhancing model generalization.
- ReFT starts with a warm-up stage of SFT before applying reinforcement learning.
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used in ReFT for refining the model.
- ReFT samples multiple correct reasoning paths and learns from them.
- ReFT does not require a separate reward model, unlike other methods.
- ReFT achieves better performance using the same training questions as SFT.
- ReFT can be combined with data engineering for further improvements.
- Experiments were conducted using foundational models like Code Llama and Galactica.
- ReFT shows improved performance on datasets like GSM 8K, Math QA, and SVM.
- ReFT benefits from majority voting and reward model reranking at inference time.
- Recent research focuses on CoT prompt design and data engineering.
- Python programs as CoT prompts provide more accurate reasoning steps.
- ReFT aims to use reinforcement learning to improve performance over conventional SFT.
- The warm-up stage helps the model develop basic problem-solving skills.
- The reinforcement learning stage involves self-learning through sampling responses.
- The reward function compares the generated answer with the correct answer.
- Partial rewards can be given for numeric answers to reduce sparse reward impact.
- Offline self-training involves sampling data from the initial policy for fine-tuning.
- Online self-training continually trains with samples generated in real-time.
- Incorrect instances are crucial for guiding the model towards better exploration.
- ReFT struggled with reward hacking during training on Math QA.
- ReFT outperforms SFT even with smaller language models like Galactica 125M.
- Partial rewards help mitigate the effect of sparse rewards during training.
- ReFT demonstrates robustness across various datasets and settings.

# INSIGHTS:
- Reinforcement learning enhances model generalization by sampling multiple reasoning paths.
- Combining SFT with RL allows models to learn from diverse problem-solving strategies.
- ReFT's ability to sample multiple correct paths leads to better performance without extra data.
- Reward functions in RL can guide models towards correct answers, improving accuracy.
- Partial rewards help reduce the impact of sparse rewards in reinforcement learning.
- Incorrect instances are essential for effective exploration in RL-based models.
- Majority voting and reward model reranking further enhance ReFT's performance.
- Python-based CoT prompts offer more precise reasoning steps than natural language prompts.
- ReFT's robustness is evident even with smaller language models and varied datasets.
