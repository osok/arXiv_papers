# SUMMARY
The text explores the use of large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on source code for Programming by Example (PBE) tasks, highlighting their potential and limitations.

# IDEAS:
- PBE constructs source code for hidden algorithms based on input-output examples.
- PBE differs from code generation using natural language by focusing on F-shot inductive inference.
- LLMs pre-trained on source code may solve PBE, expanding capabilities beyond domain-specific languages.
- Pre-trained and instruction-tuned models perform poorly in PBE tasks.
- Fine-tuning LLMs can significantly improve performance in PBE within a limited domain.
- Adapting LLMs to small, labeled data sets reduces the domain gap in generalization.
- Fine-tuned models outperform custom symbolic search algorithms and closed-source models like GP4.
- PBE systems aim to generalize to new test cases beyond provided examples.
- Domain-specific languages guide the search efficiently but limit expressiveness compared to general-purpose languages.
- Comprehensive PBE solutions in general-purpose languages benefit various inductive inference problems.
- Basic prompting involves constructing prompts from input-output examples to generate programs.
- Fine-tuning trains the model to predict programs from input-output pairs in a data set.
- Data scarcity for new PBE applications like graphics programs is addressed by creating a data set through prompting.
- Iterative pre-training and testing help adapt the model to new problem distributions.
- Fine-tuned models excel in list functions, text editing, and Logo tasks, outperforming existing baselines.
- The model's performance degrades when tested on different types of data than it was trained on.
- Description length under the approximate posterior is a better predictor of success than program size.
- Classic symbolic PBE methods synthesize programs perfectly within their defined domains.
- Adaptation methods improve out-of-distribution generalization by around 10% or more in all domains.
- LLMs can generate abstract hypotheses from specific examples and translate them into programs.
- Self-debugging strategies could advance the boundaries of PBE.
- Filtering programs based on examples helps select the best program from LLM-generated options.
- Using large neural networks for PBE may not be practical for everyday users on personal devices.
- Network compression and distillation could address the issue of large neural networks' practicality.
- Posterior likelihood is a better predictor of success than program size or prior likelihood.
- Fine-tuned LLMs outperform many existing neural and symbolic methods even in unconventional domains like Logo graphics.
- True success in real-world applications requires more than high benchmark scores.
