# SUMMARY
The WChat data set, presented by researchers, addresses the lack of accessible real-world multi-turn and multilingual chatbot interaction data, offering 1 million conversations for detailed analysis.

# IDEAS:
- WChat provides 1 million timestamped conversations with over 2.5 million interaction turns.
- It bridges the gap between expert-curated and proprietary natural use case data sets.
- The data set includes demographic details like state, country, and hashed IP addresses.
- Over 10% of interactions exhibit toxicity, highlighting an urgent area for intervention.
- WChat is effective for instruction tuning chatbots, showing potential for better data sets.
- Data collection involved deploying chatbot services powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 APIs.
- Users were not required to create accounts, ensuring anonymity and ease of access.
- A user consent mechanism was implemented for ethical data collection practices.
- Data pre-processing linked 2,736,195 turns into 1,15452 full conversations.
- Personally identifiable information was anonymized using tools like Microsoft's Presidio.
- Basic statistics of the WChat data set showcase language diversity and user prompts.
- Toxicity analysis revealed a high level of toxic content in user and chatbot turns.
- Instruction tuning involved fine-tuning a LLaMA 27B model to create Wild Yama.
- Wild Yama outperformed other open-source models but underperformed compared to proprietary models.
- The data set's high level of toxicity presents an opportunity for intervention and improvement.
- Fine-tuning on WChat can lead to stronger chatbots without extensive manual curation.
- The data set allows for a nuanced understanding of user behavior and preferences.
- The majority of users are likely associated with the IT community, influencing conversation types.
- Anonymity may attract users who prefer engaging in discourse they avoid on registered platforms.
- The URL to the chat service was shared across various subreddits, affecting user representation.
