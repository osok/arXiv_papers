- Mixol Instruct shows reduced biases and a balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks.
- The model supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens.
- Feedforward blocks are replaced by mixture of expert layers.
- The output is determined by the weighted sum of expert networks' outputs.
- Sparse gating vectors avoid computing outputs of experts with zero gates.
- The number of experts per token is a hyperparameter modulating compute usage.
- Mo layers can run efficiently on single GPUs with specialized kernels like Mega Bloks.
- Mixol uses the same sGLUE architecture as the expert function.
- Each token is routed to two sGLUE subblocks with different weights.
- Mixol outperforms Llama in coding and math tasks despite fewer active parameters.
- It performs well in multiple languages while maintaining high English accuracy.
- Mixol retrieves inserted passages with 100% accuracy regardless of context length.
- The model displays less bias than Llama on social bias benchmarks.
- Mixt Instruct achieved a top score on the MT Bench as of December 2023.
- No clear patterns were found in expert assignment based on topic during training.
- Some structured behavior in syntax was observed, like routing specific words to the same expert.
- Consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts, suggesting positional locality.

# INSIGHTS:
