# SUMMARY
The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method aims to reduce memory and computational resources for fine-tuning large language models by training only a small number of additional parameters.

# IDEAS:

- The method approximates full fine-tuning accuracy on challenging domains like code and math.
- Acts as a regularizer to mitigate forgetting of the source domain.
- Balances learning on new target domains while retaining source domain knowledge.
- Freezes pre-trained weight matrix and learns low-rank perturbations.
- Selects target modules and determines the rank for low-rank perturbations.
- Trains only D * r + r * K parameters instead of D * K.
