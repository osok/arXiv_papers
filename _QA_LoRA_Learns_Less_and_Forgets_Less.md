# SUMMARY
The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method aims to reduce memory and computational resources for fine-tuning large language models by training only a small number of additional parameters.

# IDEAS:
- LoRA reduces memory footprint and computational resources for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).
- Freezing a pre-trained LLM and training only low-rank perturbations to selected weight matrices.
- LoRA provides a more memory-efficient and sample-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning.
- The method approximates the accuracy of full fine-tuning on challenging target domains like code and math.
- Acts as a regularizer to mitigate forgetting of the source domain.
- Balances learning on the new target domain and retaining knowledge from the source domain.
- Freezes pre-trained weight matrix and learns only a low-rank perturbation to it.
- Selects target modules and determines the rank for low-rank perturbation.
- Trains the model by learning low-rank perturbation while keeping other weights frozen.
