# SUMMARY
The text discusses how scaling model parameters and dataset size improves next-token prediction in large language models. It introduces Selective Language Modeling (SLM) to enhance training efficiency by focusing on tokens with high excess loss.

# IDEAS:
- Scaling model parameters and dataset size improves next-token prediction accuracy in large language models.
- Training on all available data may not always be the best approach for model performance.
- Data filtering through heuristics and classifiers enhances data quality and model performance.
- High-quality datasets still contain noisy tokens that can disrupt training processes.
- Removing noisy tokens may alter text meaning, while strict filtering could exclude valuable data.
- Web data distribution may not align with ideal distributions for downstream applications.
- Common corpora at the token level may include challenging tokens hard to predict accurately.
- Applying the same loss to all tokens can waste computation on non-beneficial tokens.
- Analyzing training dynamics reveals easy tokens already learned and hard tokens resisting convergence.
- Introducing Selective Language Modeling (SLM) focuses on tokens with high excess loss for training.
- SLM involves training a reference model on high-quality corpora to score tokens based on desired distribution.
- SLM filters out unwanted tokens, focusing on those benefiting downstream applications the most.
- SLM significantly improves token efficiency during pre-training and enhances downstream task performance.
- SLM identifies tokens relevant to the target distribution, improving perplexity scores on benchmarks.
- Row one models trained with SLM outperform baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance using fewer tokens.
- SLM enhances performance across various benchmarks, particularly in code and math tasks.
- Selective training stabilizes the model's trajectory and improves efficiency.
- Token selection ratio determines the percentage of tokens to include based on their excess loss.
- SLM ensures the model learns primarily from tokens contributing the most, enhancing efficiency without extra costs.
- Experiments show SLM's effectiveness in both mathematical and general domains.
- Continual pre-training with SLM shows significant improvements in accuracy, especially in math-related tasks.
- Token selection ratios tailored to model size improve pre-training efficiency.
- Visualizing token selection reveals that most chosen tokens are mathematically related, enhancing training.
- Token filtering varies across checkpoints, with later checkpoints showing higher perplexity initially.
- Smaller reference models can effectively guide the pre-training of larger models despite size differences.
- Optimizing pre-training data involves improving quality and scale through collection, duplication, filtering, and selection.
- Different token patterns, including easy and hard tokens, show varying levels of convergence during training.
- Scaling laws help understand the impact of parameter count, data size, and compute on model performance.
- Future research should investigate if SLM can be applied to very large models and datasets.
