# SUMMARY
The text discusses how scaling model parameters and dataset size improves next-token prediction in large language models. It introduces Selective Language Modeling (SLM) to enhance data quality and model performance by focusing on tokens with high excess loss.

# IDEAS:
- Scaling model parameters and dataset size improves next-token prediction accuracy in large language models.
- Training on all available data may not always be the best approach for model performance.
- Data filtering through heuristics and classifiers enhances data quality and model performance.
- High-quality datasets still contain noisy tokens that can disrupt training processes.
- Removing noisy tokens may alter text meaning, while strict filtering could exclude valuable data.
- Web data distribution may not align with ideal distribution for downstream applications.
- Common corpus at the token level includes challenging tokens hard to predict accurately.
- Applying the same loss to all tokens can waste computation on non-beneficial tokens.
- Analyzing training dynamics reveals easy tokens already learned and hard tokens resisting convergence.
- Introducing Row one models trained with Selective Language Modeling (SLM) objective.
- SLM involves training a reference language model on high-quality corpora to score tokens.
- Filtering out unwanted tokens and training on high excess loss tokens improves efficiency.
- SLM significantly improves token efficiency during pre-training and enhances downstream task performance.
- SLM identifies tokens relevant to the target distribution, improving perplexity scores on benchmarks.
- Row one models outperform baselines in math continual pre-training, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
- SLM enhances performance across various benchmarks, particularly in code and math tasks.
- Selective training stabilizes the model's trajectory and improves efficiency.
- Reference models evaluate token loss, selectively training on tokens with significant excess loss.
- Token selection ratio determines the percentage of tokens to include based on excess loss.
- SLM ensures learning from tokens contributing the most, enhancing efficiency without extra costs.
- Experiments show SLM's effectiveness in both mathematical and general domains.
- Continual pre-training with SLM shows significant improvements in accuracy for math-related tasks.
- Token selection process visualized during training reveals majority of selected tokens are math-related.
- Tokens selected by later checkpoints have higher perplexity initially, suggesting optimization strategy.
- Smaller reference models can effectively guide pre-training of larger models despite size differences.
- Optimizing pre-training data involves improving quality and scale through various methods.
- Different token patterns identified during training include easy and hard tokens with varying convergence levels.
- Scaling laws help understand impact of parameter count, data size, and compute on model performance.
