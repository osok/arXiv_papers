# SUMMARY
Researchers explore leveraging human revision edits to enhance multimodal generative models in layout design, demonstrating significant benefits and highlighting the importance of human input.

# IDEAS:
- Human design revisions involve complex changes beyond simple edits, exploring different visual elements and reorganizing layouts.
- Iterative and noisy nature of human design processes contains valuable insights for improving generated layouts.
- Rare Plus dataset captures expert designers' revisions of layouts created from specific text prompts.
- Incorporating human revision edits into training improves the quality of generated layouts.
- Models incorporating human revision edits outperform those that do not, achieving design scores close to human performance.
- Early human guidance helps models avoid repetitive patterns during inference.
- Bridging the gap between human and model-generated guidance is crucial in layout design tasks.
- Generating final design code based on initial UI layout state and language prompt differs from stateless generation.
- Human revision edits are often experimental and lengthy, involving hundreds of changes.
- Transitioning from an initial state to a later state aims to improve the design.
- Direct model generates final designs from layout states; hop model iteratively edits designs.
- Single revision model incorporates human edits; multi-revision model uses subsets of revision states for guidance.
- Multimodal inputs constructed as sequences of tokens including text and visual elements.
- Training focuses on output text tokens; evaluation done by rendering layouts as images and computing FID scores.
- Incorporating edits during training improves performance at test time, even without providing these edits during testing.
- Single revision model performed best; multi-revision model did not perform as well due to longer edit contexts.
- Human revision edits improve model performance, approaching expert-level FID scores.
- Involving humans in iterative revision process improves model performance significantly.
- Models engage in actual editing rather than copy-pasting previous revisions.
- Models tend to repeat themselves beyond the first round, leading to increased repetition.
- Adjusting decoding temperature reduces repetition but does not eliminate it.
- Human edits result in more significant design changes compared to model-generated ones.
