# SUMMARY
The introduction discusses recent progress in large language models (LLMs) and their impact on natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). Despite their advancements, LLMs have not consistently outperformed smaller models in IR tasks. To address this, a new dataset called INTERS was developed to enhance LLMs' search capabilities by focusing on query understanding, document understanding, and the relationship between queries and documents. Experimental results show that INTERS improves LLM performance across various search tasks.
