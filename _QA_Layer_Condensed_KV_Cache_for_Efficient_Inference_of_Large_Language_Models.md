# SUMMARY
The proposed method aims to reduce high memory consumption in large language models (LLMs) by decreasing the number of cached layers in Transformer decoders, thus improving throughput and efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- The method reduces memory consumption by decreasing the number of cached layers in Transformer decoders.
- Queries of all layers are paired with keys and values of only the top layer.
- Eliminating the need to cache or compute keys and values for other layers saves memory.
- The method addresses the cyclic dependency issue by masking the diagonal of the attention matrix.
- Zero vectors are used as dummy keys and values for the first token.
- Standard attention is retained for a small number of warm-up layers to maintain performance.
- The algorithm sequentially computes tokens in a bottom-up Transformer computation graph.
- Cross-entropy loss is computed only after the last iteration to break sequential dependencies.
- Gradient stopping is applied to backpropagate the loss through a limited number of iterations.
- Key values converge quickly over iterations, allowing for approximation with fewer iterations.
- The method can be integrated with other memory-saving techniques like streaming LLM.
- Experimenting with different configurations helps balance model performance and throughput.
- The method achieves up to 32 times larger batch sizes and 26 times higher throughput.
- Competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks is maintained.
- The method offers flexibility in choosing the number and placement of warm-up layers.
- Extensive experiments on the Llama model validate the method's effectiveness.
- Integration with streaming LLM shows lower latency and memory consumption.
- The model processes inputs with a sequence length of 4 million tokens while maintaining stable perplexity.
- Almost no performance degradation is observed with warm-up layers set to 10.
- The method allows for a trade-off between model performance and throughput.
- Underperformance occurs when all layers are condensed to just the top layer for KV caching.
- Retaining standard attention for warm-up layers slightly diminishes memory savings but improves performance.
- Sequential dependencies created by top layer KV dependencies require an approximate training method.
- Backpropagation through all iterations may result in a large computation graph that cannot fit into GPU memory.
- Gradient stopping is necessary to backpropagate only through a limited number of iterations.
- The training process is more time-consuming compared to standard Transformers.
