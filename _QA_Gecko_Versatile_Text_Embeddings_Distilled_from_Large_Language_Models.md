- Gecko generates relevant tasks and queries for passages using few-shot prompted LLMs.
- Reranking passages based on LLM scores improves text embedding quality.
- Gecko aims to create a versatile embedding model supporting multiple tasks efficiently.
- Knowledge distillation techniques integrate LLMs' knowledge into the text embedding model.
- The reranking step identifies the best passage to answer generated queries.
- Gecko combines LLM-generated data with human-annotated data for training.
- The Fret dataset provides diverse, high-quality synthetic data for fine-tuning.
- Fret dataset consists of 6 million examples with tasks, queries, positive and negative passages.
- Gecko achieves superior performance on the MTE Benchmark among models with similar dimensions.
- LLM-based positive and negative mining identifies relevant passages for generated queries.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) ensembles rankings from two prompting methods.
- The training recipe includes pre-fine-tuning and fine-tuning stages.
- Pre-fine-tuning uses a large text corpus for self-supervised tasks.
- Fine-tuning uses the Fret dataset combined with other academic datasets.
- Contrastive learning objective optimized with in-batch negatives using cosine similarity.
- Academic datasets include Natural Questions, HotpotQA, FEVER, MedMCQA, SNLI, MNLI.
