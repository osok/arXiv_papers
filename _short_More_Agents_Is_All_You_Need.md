# SUMMARY
The paper introduces a five-step methodology to enhance decision-making using language models, focusing on sample generation, majority voting, and cumulative similarity evaluation.

# IDEAS:
- A novel approach enhances decision-making by leveraging the power of language models.
- The methodology is structured into five key steps designed to generate, evaluate, and select answers.
- Initially, the focus is on generating a diverse array of samples by querying the language model.
- Querying the language model multiple times improves the sampling process.
- Integrating the method with other techniques increases efficiency and diversity in sample generation.
- Following sample generation, a comprehensive set of samples is obtained for the voting phase.
- The collection of samples serves as the foundation for the decision-making process.
- A majority voting mechanism consolidates samples into a final answer.
- Majority voting leverages the collective opinion of samples, enhancing decision-making.
- Cumulative similarity for each sample is calculated in relation to others.
- Cumulative similarity calculation is pivotal in determining the most similar sample.
- The most similar sample is indicative of its relevance and accuracy.
- Objective evaluation of samples against one another is achieved through cumulative similarity assessment.
- The sample with the highest cumulative similarity is selected as the final answer.
- The most similar sample is likely the most accurate and relevant.
- Choosing the sample with the highest similarity ensures it represents collective opinion.
- The comprehensive approach aims to improve accuracy and reliability of decisions using language models.
- Enhancing decision-making processes can significantly impact various fields and applications.
- Language models can be integrated with other techniques for better performance.
- Majority voting mechanisms can be applied to various decision-making scenarios.
