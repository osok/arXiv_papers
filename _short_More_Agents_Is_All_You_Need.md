# SUMMARY
The paper introduces a five-step methodology to enhance decision-making using language models, focusing on sample generation, majority voting, and cumulative similarity evaluation.

# IDEAS:
- A novel approach enhances decision-making by leveraging the power of language models.
- The methodology is structured into five key steps for generating, evaluating, and selecting answers.
- Initially, the focus is on generating a diverse array of samples by querying the language model.
- Querying the language model multiple times improves the sampling process.
- Integrating the method with other techniques increases efficiency and diversity in sample generation.
- A comprehensive set of samples is obtained for the subsequent voting phase.
- The collection of samples serves as the foundation for the decision-making process.
- A majority voting mechanism consolidates samples into a final answer.
- Majority voting leverages the collective opinion of samples to enhance decision-making.
- Cumulative similarity for each sample is calculated in relation to others.
- Cumulative similarity calculation is pivotal in determining the most similar sample.
- The most similar sample is indicative of its relevance and accuracy.
- Objective evaluation of samples against one another is achieved through cumulative similarity assessment.
- The sample with the highest cumulative similarity is selected as the final answer.
- The most similar sample is likely the most accurate and relevant.
- The final answer represents the collective opinion of the samples.
- The comprehensive approach aims to improve accuracy and reliability in decisions made using language models.
- Enhancing decision-making processes can significantly impact various fields and applications.
- Leveraging language models can lead to more informed and reliable decisions.
- The methodology integrates multiple techniques to optimize sample generation and selection.
