# SUMMARY
The paper introduces a five-step methodology to enhance decision-making using language models, focusing on sample generation, majority voting, and cumulative similarity evaluation.

# IDEAS:
- A novel approach enhances decision-making by leveraging language models.
- Methodology structured into five key steps for generating, evaluating, and selecting answers.
- Initial focus on generating diverse samples by querying the language model multiple times.
- Improved sampling process by integrating with other techniques.
- Comprehensive set of samples obtained for the subsequent voting phase.
- Majority voting mechanism consolidates samples into a final answer.
- Majority voting leverages collective opinion to enhance decision-making.
- Cumulative similarity calculated for each sample in relation to others.
- Cumulative similarity determines the most similar and relevant sample.
- Objective evaluation of samples against one another through cumulative similarity.
- Final answer selected based on highest cumulative similarity.
- Most similar sample is likely the most accurate and relevant.
- Final answer represents the collective opinion of the samples.
- Comprehensive approach aims to improve accuracy and reliability of decisions.
- Language models can significantly enhance decision-making processes.

# INSIGHTS:
- Diverse sample generation improves decision-making accuracy.
- Majority voting leverages collective intelligence for better decisions.
- Cumulative similarity ensures objective sample evaluation.
- Integration with other techniques enhances sampling efficiency.
- Final answer reflects collective sample opinion.
