# SUMMARY
The discussion focuses on combining large language models (LLMs) with specialized models to create new capabilities. The proposed framework, Comm, introduces trainable parameters to combine models effectively.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) can reason, generate coherent language, and grasp world knowledge.
- Specialized models are fine-tuned for tasks like code generation, text editing, and solving math problems.
- Combining general and specialized models could create new abilities, like translating code into text.
- Training large models is costly in terms of computation and data privacy concerns.
- Reusing existing models avoids the problem of catastrophic forgetting common in conventional approaches.
- Comm framework introduces trainable parameters over both specialized and general models' intermediate layer representations.
- Comm combines models to perform new tasks more accurately while preserving individual capabilities.
- Comm outperforms base models and other fine-tuning methods in language inclusivity and code generation tasks.
- Previous attempts to combine models have tried routing or merging, but neither is effective in this setting.
- Comm introduces a small number of trainable parameters over both specialized and general models' intermediate layer representations.
- Comm finds an effective combination of models to perform new challenging tasks more accurately than either model alone.
- Comm preserves the capabilities of individual models while combining them.
- Comm is significantly more effective than Laura, a representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning method.
- Comm is applicable to any set of models, regardless of their size or training objectives.
- Combining models allows for better control and avoids the problem of catastrophic forgetting.
- Comm enables a model to be adapted to completely new domains using a specialized model.
- Comm introduces cross-attention layers that cross-attend between transformed layer representations from different models.
- The combined model can solve arithmetic expressions containing keys from a knowledge artifact.
- The combined model outperforms both individual models on translation and math problem-solving tasks in low-resource languages.
- Fine-tuning a large model on low-resource language data can lead to catastrophic forgetting.
- Combining a large model with a specialized model using Comm avoids the problem of catastrophic forgetting.
- Comm can combine code understanding and generation capabilities in language models.
- The combined model performs well on code completion, text-to-code generation, and code-to-text generation tasks.
- The combined model retains performance across all languages and tasks.
- Using simpler or random versions of the specialized model leads to a significant drop in performance.
- Iterative decoding improves performance across tasks when using the combined model.

- Cross-attention layers enable effective combination of different models' capabilities.
- The combined model can generalize to new tasks using only a fraction of training data.
- Fine-tuning large models on new data can lead to catastrophic forgetting, but Comm avoids this issue.
- Combining code understanding and generation capabilities enhances performance across multiple tasks.
