# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks and propose "dup prompting" to enhance problem comprehension and reasoning accuracy.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs face challenges in reasoning tasks despite their impressive performance in various NLP tasks.
- Increasing model sizes alone cannot address the limitations in LLMs' reasoning abilities.
- Enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs is necessary for better performance.
- Few-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting involves natural language reasoning before providing the final answer.
- Modifying prompt strategies can guide LLMs towards better reasoning quality.
- Zero-shot CoT, Tree of Thought, Plan and Solve, and Complex CoT aim to improve reasoning steps.
- Zero-shot CoT strategy resulted in many incorrect responses from GPT-3.5 Turbo due to understanding issues.
- Dup prompting enhances reasoning ability by improving LLM's understanding of the question.
- Dup prompting consists of three stages: extracting the core question, gathering problem-solving information, and generating responses.
- Dup prompting outperforms zero-shot CoT, zero-shot Plan and Solve, and least-to-most prompting consistently.
- Dup prompting shows improvements compared to few-shot manual CoT and auto-CoT prompting strategies.
- Dup prompting does not require manual demonstration examples.
- Dup prompting proves effective in producing high-quality reasoning steps and accurate answers.
- Understanding the entire problem is crucial for improving reasoning accuracy in LLMs.
- Extracting the main question from a lengthy problem description is essential for solving it accurately.
- Extracting problem-solving information ensures that LLMs can make full use of them during reasoning.
- Combining the core question and problem-solving information helps LLMs focus on the main goal.
- Dup prompting significantly improves reasoning performance on arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks.
- Dup prompting boosts accuracy by an average of 4% over zero-shot CoT in GPT-3.5 Turbo settings.
- Dup prompting achieves top-notch results on SVAM (94.2%) and GSM 8K (97.1%) in GPT-4 settings.
- Dup prompting outperforms other zero-shot baselines across all arithmetic reasoning data sets.
- Dup prompting shows superior performance with an average accuracy of 84.9% in few-shot methods within GPT-3.5 Turbo settings.
- Dup prompting outperforms all other baseline zero-shot methods in common sense reasoning.
- Zero-shot dup prompting performs slightly worse than zero-shot least-to-most on last letters but better on coin flip.
- Ablation study shows each stage of dup prompting is crucial for solving reasoning problems.
- Merged dup-s prompting strategy showed better accuracy in some data sets but slightly lower average performance.
- Dup prompting is compatible with self-consistency (SC) decoding strategy, enhancing performance.
- Dup prompting outperforms zero-shot CoT across all LLMs tested, including smaller parameter models.
- High-quality extracted information is crucial for overall performance in dup prompting.
- Dup prompting substantially reduces the occurrence of various error types compared to zero-shot CoT.

# INSIGHTS:
- Enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities requires more than just increasing model sizes.
