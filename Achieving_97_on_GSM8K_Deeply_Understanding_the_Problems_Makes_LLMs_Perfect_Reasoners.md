# SUMMARY
Researchers discuss the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks and propose a novel "dup prompting" method to enhance problem comprehension and accuracy.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs face challenges in reasoning tasks despite their impressive performance in NLP tasks.
- Increasing model sizes alone cannot address the reasoning limitations of LLMs.
- Enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities is necessary for better performance.
- Few-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning by engaging in natural language reasoning.
- Researchers are modifying prompt strategies to guide LLMs towards better reasoning quality.
- Zero-shot CoT, Tree of Thought (ToT), Plan and Solve (PS), and Complex CoT aim to improve reasoning steps.
- Many methods overlook whether LLMs truly understand the entire problem.
- Zero-shot CoT strategy resulted in many incorrect responses from GPT-3.5 Turbo due to understanding issues.
- Dup prompting enhances reasoning ability by improving LLMs' understanding of the question.
- Dup prompting consists of three stages: extracting the core question, gathering problem-solving information, and generating responses.
- Dup prompting aims to help LLMs achieve a clear understanding of the problem.
- Experiments show dup prompting outperforms zero-shot CoT, zero-shot PS+, and least-to-most prompting.
- Dup prompting shows improvements compared to few-shot manual CoT and auto-CoT without requiring manual examples.
- Dup prompting proves effective in producing high-quality reasoning steps and accurate answers.
- Dup prompting significantly improves reasoning performance on arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks.
- Dup prompting boosts accuracy by an average of 4% over zero-shot CoT in GPT-3.5 Turbo settings.
- Dup prompting achieves top-notch results on SVAM (94.2%) and GSM 8K (97.1%) in GPT-4 settings.
- Dup prompting consistently outperforms other zero-shot baselines across all arithmetic reasoning datasets.
- Dup prompting shows superior performance with an average accuracy of 84.9% in few-shot methods within GPT-3.5 Turbo settings.
- Dup prompting outperforms all other baseline zero-shot methods in common sense reasoning.
- Zero-shot dup prompting achieves 74.5% accuracy on the Common Sense QA dataset.
- Dup prompting performs slightly worse than zero-shot least-to-most on last letters but better on coin flip.
- Ablation study shows each stage of dup prompting is crucial for solving reasoning problems.
- Merged dup-s prompting strategy showed better accuracy in some datasets but slightly lower average performance.
- Dup prompting is compatible with self-consistency (SC) decoding strategy, enhancing performance.
- Dup prompting outperforms zero-shot CoT when combined with SC decoding strategy.
- Dup prompting works well on other LLMs with smaller parameters like LLaMA 2 Chat 13B and 70B.
- Quality of core questions and problem-solving information is crucial for dup prompting effectiveness.
- High-quality extracted information significantly enhances performance in dup prompting strategy.
- Dup prompting reduces the occurrence of understanding, process, and calculation errors compared to zero-shot CoT.
