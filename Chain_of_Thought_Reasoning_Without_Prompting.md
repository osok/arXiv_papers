# SUMMARY
Researchers explore how large language models (LLMs) can reason without explicit prompting by altering the decoding process, revealing natural Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning paths.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models can reason without explicit prompting by altering the decoding process.
- Traditional methods include few-shot prompting, zero-shot prompting, and extensive training on reasoning tasks.
- Researchers discovered pre-trained LLMs can exhibit CoT reasoning by changing answer generation.
- CoT reasoning paths are naturally present but often ignored by the model.
- Allowing models to consider different options before deciding improves reasoning accuracy.
- CoT decoding method helps identify reliable reasoning paths without additional training.
- CoT decoding reveals natural CoT reasoning, enhancing performance across various tasks.
- Models are better at reasoning through tasks seen during initial training.
- CoT paths don't always get the highest rankings in model's probability assessments.
- Confidence levels indicated by logits show higher confidence in CoT paths.
- Longer decoding paths might contain CoT components, especially in math reasoning.
- Identifying answer spans involves picking the last numerical value or final option.
- Extending model output with prompts like "so the answer is" aligns continuations with spans.
- Branching out early in decoding increases diversity of potential paths.
- Aggregating top K decoding paths improves model performance over single best path selection.
- Sampling introduces randomness but often skips reasoning steps, reducing accuracy.
- CoT decoding significantly improves reasoning tasks, especially in math.
- Higher K values generally lead to better performance in CoT decoding.
- Instruction-tuned models bring relevant CoT paths to the forefront.
- Year parity task shows CoT decoding improves accuracy from 50% to over 90%.
- Smaller models struggle with complex tasks, showing little variation in performance.
- Symbolic reasoning tasks highlight the importance of accurate state tracking.
- CoT prompting techniques help models solve tasks accurately in complex scenarios.
- Aggregated path approach boosts accuracy compared to highest score path selection.
- CoT decoding produces more varied and free-form CoT generations than prompting methods.
- Instruction-tuned models benefit from considering alternative tokens at the first step of decoding.
- Decoding algorithms like greedy decoding, temperature sampling, and nucleus sampling enhance language generation aspects.
- Contrastive decoding penalizes logits from smaller models, boosting reasoning performance.
- Context-aware decoding increases faithfulness by incorporating more context into the process.
