# SUMMARY
Researchers explore how large language models (LLMs) can reason without explicit prompting by altering the decoding process, revealing natural Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning paths.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs can reason without explicit prompting by changing how they generate answers.
- Traditional methods include few-shot and zero-shot prompting for reasoning tasks.
- CoT reasoning can be revealed by considering alternative options usually ignored by the model.
- CoT decoding improves model performance on reasoning tasks without additional training.
- Allowing models to consider different options before deciding enhances reasoning.
- CoT decoding shows models are more confident in their final answers.
- CoT decoding is unsupervised and doesn't require additional training.
- CoT paths naturally occur but are tricky to identify among top choices.
- CoT paths often don't get the highest rankings in model probability assessments.
- Confidence levels indicated by logits help identify CoT paths.
- Longer decoding paths might contain CoT components, especially in math reasoning.
- Identifying answer spans in model responses is crucial for accurate CoT decoding.
- Aggregating top K decoding paths improves model performance.
- Sampling introduces randomness but isn't effective for finding CoT reasoning paths.
- CoT decoding significantly improves reasoning tasks, especially in math.
- Instruction-tuned models benefit from CoT decoding, enhancing their performance.
- Higher K values generally lead to better performance in CoT decoding.
- Models struggle with synthetic tasks not well-represented in training data.
- Accurate state tracking is essential for complex tasks like coin flip and Web of Lies.
- Few-shot CoT prompting brings natural CoT paths to the forefront.
- Aggregated path approach boosts accuracy compared to selecting the highest score path.
- CoT decoding reveals the model's intrinsic strategy without external prompts.
- Diverse beam search prioritizes diversity over accuracy in model generation.
- Contrastive decoding enhances reasoning performance by penalizing logits from smaller models.
