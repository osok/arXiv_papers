- Allowing models to consider different options before deciding enhances their reasoning ability.
- CoT decoding reveals natural CoT reasoning in models, improving task performance.
- Models are better at reasoning through tasks seen during initial training.
- CoT paths don't always get the highest rankings in model probability assessments.
- Confidence levels indicated by logits show higher confidence in CoT paths.
- Longer decoding paths might be more likely to contain CoT reasoning.
- Identifying answer spans in model responses is crucial for accurate reasoning.
- Aggregating top K decoding paths improves model performance over selecting a single best path.
- Sampling introduces randomness but often skips the reasoning process.
- CoT decoding significantly improves models' ability to reason through tasks like math problems.
- Instruction-tuned models benefit from CoT decoding, enhancing their performance.
- Higher K values generally lead to better model performance in reasoning tasks.
- Models struggle with highly synthetic tasks not well represented in training data.
- Accurate state tracking is essential for tasks like coin flip and Web of Lies.
- Few-shot CoT prompting brings models' natural CoT paths to the forefront.
- CoT decoding produces more varied and free-form CoT generations.
- Decoding algorithms like greedy decoding, temperature sampling, and nucleus sampling enhance language generation.
- Contrastive decoding penalizes logits from smaller models, boosting reasoning performance.

# INSIGHTS:
