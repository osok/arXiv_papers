# SUMMARY
The new method, Alignment via Optimal Transport (Maths FAOT), aims to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences using a distributional optimization approach.

# IDEAS:
- Maths FAOT aligns LLMs with human preferences by inducing stochastic dominance of chosen responses over rejected ones.
- The method ensures that LLMs follow human values, ethics, and desired behaviors.
- It reduces the risk of generating harmful, biased, or inappropriate content.
- Maths FAOT uses a new objective function to encourage dominance of chosen rewards over rejected rewards.
- The method works in both paired and unpaired settings for aligning LLMs.
- It involves defining a reward model based on the log-likelihood ratio between LLM policy and reference model.
- The optimization problem minimizes the violation of first-order stochastic dominance (FSD).
- The problem is cast as a one-dimensional optimal transport problem with a convex cost function.
- A sorting algorithm matches quantiles of chosen and rejected rewards.
- Soft sorting techniques like Sinkhorn algorithm allow backpropagation during optimization.
- The method adapts for unpaired data by defining rewards based on positive and negative outcomes.
- For paired data, it considers the log-likelihood ratio of positive to negative outcomes under optimized policies.
- The method satisfies assumptions on OT cost, reward, and policy hypothesis class for statistical analysis.
- Performance is evaluated against other alignment approaches on various datasets and benchmarks.
