- Older RNN models summarize long contexts in a single hidden state but have training challenges.
- State space models like Mamba are efficient and handle long-distance relationships well.
- Jamba balances memory usage, training efficiency, and long context capabilities.
- Jamba is the first production-grade attention SSM hybrid model.
- Mo layers increase model capacity without increasing compute requirements.
- Jamba supports a context length of 256k tokens, the longest among publicly available models.
- Jamba outperforms other models on long context tasks and is highly efficient.
- Jamba's architecture includes a mix of Mamba and attention layers with Mo modules.
- Increasing the ratio of Mamba layers improves throughput for long sequences.
- Jamba's implementation on a single 80 GB GPU includes four Jamba blocks.
