# SUMMARY
The discussion, led by the authors, focuses on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and introduces Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPO) as a superior alternative to reward model-based approaches.

# IDEAS:
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) optimizes policies based on relative feedback rather than absolute scores.
- RLHF is easier for humans to provide comparative feedback rather than absolute scores for an agent's behavior.
- RLHF has been successfully used in fields like robotics, recommendation, and retrieval.
- The most common approach to RLHF is through reward-based RLHF, a two-step process.
- Reward-based RLHF assumes a total order over agent behavior, contradicting human decision-making psychology.
- Combining preferences from a large group of raters often fails to maintain a total order.
- Reward models can lead to a lack of diversity in generation, leaving some raters unsatisfied.
- Alternative approaches to RLHF don't rely on reward models, such as framing it as a two-player zero-sum game.
- Adversarial training in two-player zero-sum games is unstable in practice.
- SPO eliminates reward models and adversarial training by framing RLHF as a two-player zero-sum game.
- SPO trains a single agent in a self-play fashion, sampling multiple trajectories and comparing them.
- SPO uses the concept of a Minimax winner from social choice theory to frame RLHF.
- SPO converges to an approximate Minimax winner at the rate of the underlying no-regret algorithm.
- SPO performs better than reward model-based approaches on continuous control tasks with realistic preference functions.
- Previous work on dueling bandits and dueling reinforcement learning algorithms explored preference-based optimization.
- SPO uses a reduction to no-regret online learning, allowing for any no-regret algorithm without additional assumptions.
- SPO's approach is the preference-based analog of inverse reinforcement learning approaches.
- Social choice theory explores selecting options that satisfy diverse preferences of a population.
- Copeland winners select options that beat the largest number of other options but may not be unique.
- Minimax winners are the Nash equilibrium of a two-player zero-sum game with payoffs given by the preference function.
- Efficient algorithms for computing Nash equilibria of two-player zero-sum games are central in computational game theory.
- SPO uses history-dependent soft policy iteration as its policy optimizer.
- Natural policy gradient (NPG) algorithm is equivalent to soft policy iteration for certain policy parameterizations.
- SPO requires sampling multiple trajectories per policy update, using win rate against a queue for labeling trajectories.
- SPO is compatible with batched queries, allowing direct preference labels from humans or expert models.
- Experiments show SPO performs better across various preference structures compared to iterative reward modeling approaches.
