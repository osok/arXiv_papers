# SUMMARY
The new method, Auto, aims to improve image quality in denoising diffusion models by separating prompt alignment and image quality improvement, addressing issues in the existing classifier-free guidance (CFG) method.

# IDEAS:
- Auto improves image quality in denoising diffusion models by separating prompt alignment and image quality improvement.
- The method addresses skewed and oversimplified image compositions resulting from CFG's trajectory overshooting.
- Auto uses an inferior version of the main model as the guiding model with unchanged conditioning.
- The guiding model is trained on the same task but suffers from degradations like low capacity or undertraining.
- The guiding process improves image quality by addressing the main model's limitations.
- The difference between predictions of the main and guiding models is measured and used to boost the guiding model's prediction.
- This process pulls samples closer to the data distribution without dropping any part of it.
- Auto focuses on regions where the main model may underfit, producing more realistic images.
- The method avoids unrealistic and broken images by pulling samples towards the core of the data manifold.
- Auto preserves image style and visual complexity better than traditional methods like CFG.
- The method can be applied to both conditional and unconditional models.
- Auto sets new records in image generation tasks by improving image distribution metrics like FID and FDDI.
- The method allows for new artistic control by using multiple guiding models simultaneously.
- Auto is adaptable to different network architectures, datasets, and training details.
- The method is validated by conducting controlled experiments using synthetic corruptions on a well-trained real-world image diffusion model.
- The guiding model is constructed with degradations like reduced capacity or shorter training time compared to the main model.
- Auto undoes the damage caused by corruptions when degradations are compatible.
- Different combinations of degradations are tested to determine the method's effectiveness.
- Auto achieved significant improvements in image quality in various synthetic test cases and practical settings.
- The method improved generated image distributions considerably when measured using FID and FDDI metrics.
- Auto outperformed the concurrently proposed CFG+ guidance interval method.
- Limitations include potential distorted sampling trajectories, exaggerated truncation, mode dropping, and oversaturation of colors.
- The method may lead to skewed and overly simplified image compositions due to trajectory overshooting.
- Lack of separate control over prompt alignment and quality improvement effects is a drawback.
- The method relies on the assumption that the guiding model suffers from similar degradations as the main model.
- Careful selection of hyperparameters like model capacity, training time, and weight values is required for optimal results.
- Future work includes formally proving conditions for Auto's benefits and deriving rules for selecting the best guiding model.
- Exploring how to make Auto more widely applicable and effective in practical settings is suggested.
