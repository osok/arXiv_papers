# SUMMARY
The paper discusses a taxonomy for language model (LM) memorization, categorizing it into recitation, reconstruction, and recollection, and explores factors and models predicting memorization.

# IDEAS:
- Recitation involves generating verbatim copies of common texts like webpage boilerplate or software licenses.
- Reconstruction occurs when the model learns templates and reconstructs samples based on broadly applicable patterns.
- Recollection refers to memorizing rare sequences not highly duplicated or easily reconstructed.
- The taxonomy allows for a nuanced understanding of how LM memorization occurs.
- Experiments highlight the multifaceted nature of memorization, comparing memorized and unmoral differences.
- Predictive models based on the taxonomy outperform generic approaches in predicting memorization.
- Statistical tests confirm significant differences in dependencies across taxonomic categories.
- Duplicates in the training corpus are a factor in determining if a sequence is memorized.
- Semantic matches assess the similarity of samples in training using document embeddings.
- Textual matches identify sequences with low Levenshtein edit distance in their prompts.
- Token frequency statistics are computed for individual tokens in the sequence.
- Templating involves identifying predictable patterns like repeating or incrementing sequences.
- Compressibility measures how easily a sequence can be compressed.
- Perplexity, the average perplexity across tokens, is considered a factor in memorization.
- Logistic regressions predict memorization by training separate models for each taxonomic category.
- Larger models tend to memorize more data, with recollection growing the most as model size increases.
- Reconstruction barely increases with model size, indicating smaller models are effective at extrapolating templates.
- The proportion of recitation decreases relative to overall memorization as model size increases.
- The intuitive taxonomic model outperforms both the generic baseline and optimally partitioned models in predicting memorization.
- The intuitive taxonomic model is better calibrated and more accurate overall except for the recollection set.
- Differences in dependencies between features support the intuitive taxonomy as an ontology.

# INSIGHTS:
- Recitation, reconstruction, and recollection offer a nuanced understanding of LM memorization processes.
- Larger models disproportionately increase recollection, suggesting they memorize rarer sequences more effectively.
- Predictive models tailored to taxonomic categories outperform generic approaches in predicting memorization.
- Statistical tests confirm significant differences in dependencies across taxonomic categories.
- The intuitive taxonomic model is better calibrated and more accurate overall except for recollection.
