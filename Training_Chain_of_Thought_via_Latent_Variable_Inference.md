# SUMMARY
The text discusses how large language models (LLMs) can solve complex reasoning problems more accurately using a step-by-step method called Chain of Thought (CoT). The authors introduce a new learning algorithm, Trice, which improves model performance by averaging over rationales during training.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models solve complex reasoning problems better with step-by-step guidance.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) method encourages models to generate reasoning steps.
- Generating rationales is easier for models than producing final answers directly.
- Fine-tuning models on high-quality rationales can improve their performance.
- High-quality rationales can be obtained through crowdsourcing or automated methods.
- Self-taught Reasoner (STAR) generates rationales and fine-tunes on correct ones.
- Trice views CoT methods as probabilistic latent variable models.
- Trice defines a joint probability distribution over questions, rationales, and answers.
- Trice uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.
- Trice stabilizes convergence and improves performance compared to STAR.
- Trice learns from both correct and incorrect rationales.
- Trice outperforms models tuned with STAR and direct tuning on GSM 8K dataset.
- Trice uses a binary likelihood model for question-answering tasks.
- Trice initializes memory with latent rationales sampled from a hinted guide distribution.
- Trice proposes new rationales and updates memory with correct ones.
- Trice reduces variance of gradient estimator using control variate scheme.
- Trice's control variate reduces variance to zero as model accuracy improves.
- Trice resamples rationales every iteration to avoid overfitting.
- Trice's MCMC method approximates gradient of marginal log likelihood.
- Trice's control variate involves subtracting zero mean random variable from estimator.
- Trice's control variate reduces variance if positively correlated with estimator.
- Trice's control variate uses proposed samples to generate control variates.
- Trice's control variate multiplies gradient estimator by 1 minus probability of correct answer.
- Trice's control variate reduces cost using resampling to select subset of rationales.
- Trice's MCMC method allows faster convergence and better final results.
- Trice's approach differs from STAR by resampling rationales and using more powerful base models.
- Trice's experiments show high training accuracy on GSM 8K and BBH tasks.
- Trice uses prompt tuning instead of fine-tuning model weights.
- Trice outperforms other prompt tuning methods and supervised fine-tuning on human-generated rationales.
- Trice's core strategy could be applied to other problems like tool use.
- Trice's performance on smaller or larger models remains unknown.
- Proprietary LLMs often lack public access to gradient-based fine-tuning tools.
- Fine-tuning on unfiltered data sets could introduce biases into models.

# INSIGHTS:
- Step-by-step guidance helps LLMs solve complex reasoning problems more accurately.
