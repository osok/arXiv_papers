# SUMMARY
IBM discusses aligning large language models (LLMs) to specific regulations using a tool called Alignment Studio, emphasizing customization beyond common practices.

# IDEAS:
- Pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned to enhance capabilities like following instructions and engaging in useful conversations.
- Alignment ensures LLMs behave according to a definition of harmlessness, preventing hate speech, malice, and toxicity.
- Context plays a significant role in determining appropriate LLM behavior for different industries and regions.
- IBM uses detailed business conduct guidelines to align LLM behavior with corporate values and legal obligations.
- Open models are necessary for alignment beyond common concerns, ensuring transparency and auditability.
- Alignment Studio uses natural language policy documents to align LLM behavior in a principled manner.
- Framers generate instruction and scenario data for model customization and validation.
- Instructors fine-tune the model based on high-quality demonstrations or reinforcement learning.
- Auditors assess whether the model has learned desired behaviors through systematic evaluation.
- Red teaming involves comparing aligned and unaligned models to test adherence to regulations.
- Synthetic data generation helps expand training datasets, enhancing model generalization.
- Ontologies combined with LLMs provide structured factual information and advanced natural language understanding.
- Efficient optimization strategies like quantized low-rank adaptations are used for fine-tuning in low-resource scenarios.
- A user interface allows comparison of responses between aligned and unaligned models, capturing user preferences.
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances the faithfulness of aligned models' responses.
- Continuous evaluation ensures the model meets desired criteria and adapts to new requirements.
- Customizing LLM behavior to meet specific values calls for tools like Alignment Studio.
- The alignment process should not be overly complex or costly for developers.
- Different industries have unique requirements that may not be addressed in standard taxonomies.
- IBM's internal chatbot application uses BCG policies as constraints for responses on various topics.
- Manual and synthetic data generation ensures diverse policy-related instructions and scenarios for training.
- Red teaming provides insights for improving aligned models by identifying areas for enhancement.
- The auditor's goal is to validate initial alignment and ensure continual desired behavior of the model.
