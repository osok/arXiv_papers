- T R NS a g n TS uses a multi-agent approach for literary translation.
- The translation process at T R NS a g n TS involves senior editors, junior editors, translators, localization specialists, and proofreaders.
- Strategies like addition by subtraction and trilateral collaboration are used to improve translation quality.
- Evaluating literary translations is difficult due to the subjective nature of literature.
- Monolingual human preference (MHP) and bilingual LLM preference (BLP) are proposed evaluation strategies.
- T R NS a g n TS may have lower BLEU scores but is preferred by human and LLM evaluators.
- T R NS a g n TS excels in genres requiring domain-specific knowledge but struggles in contemporary genres.
- Using T R NS a g n TS for literary translation can lead to cost savings compared to human translators.
- The company uses GP4 TBO to create 30 virtual agent profiles for each role.
- Addition by subtraction collaboration involves one agent extracting information and another refining it.
- Trilateral collaboration divides tasks into action, critique, and judgment branches.
- The translation workflow includes preparation and execution stages.
- The execution phase involves translation, cultural adaptation, proofreading, and final review.
- The judgment agent evaluates response quality without needing conversation history.
- Standard evaluation uses the BLEU metric, while preference evaluation involves human and LLM preferences.
- Human evaluators compare pairs of segments describing the same part of the story.
- Positional bias is mitigated by randomly switching the positions of translation segments.
- Linguistic diversity is measured using MATTR and MTLD metrics.
- T R NS a g n TS improves linguistic diversity compared to the original text.
- Human translation services can be costly, but T R NS a g n TS offers significant cost savings.
- Cultural adaptation accurately reflects linguistic and cultural differences between languages.
- Content omission is a concern in both GPT 41106 preview and T R NS a g n TS translations.
- Professional translators praise T R NS a g n TS for its expressive and engaging style.
- Traditional machine translation evaluation techniques may have shortcomings.
