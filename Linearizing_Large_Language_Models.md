# SUMMARY
The text discusses the shift from RNNs to Transformers for sequence modeling, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each. It introduces Supra, a method to fine-tune large Transformers into efficient RNNs, and explores various architectures and techniques to improve performance on long-context tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Transformers have become more popular than RNNs for sequence modeling due to parallel training efficiency.
- Transformers incur higher inference costs compared to RNNs, increasing linearly with the number of tokens.
- Combining benefits of Transformers and RNNs can reduce costs for language and multimodal models.
- Linearized attention and recurrence blur the line between Transformers and RNNs.
- New RNN architectures like RW KV, Transor, and Griffin aim to bridge the performance gap with Transformers.
- State space models (SSMs) combine RNNs and convolutional networks to model long sequences efficiently.
- Mamba architecture, a type of SSM, matches or surpasses softmax Transformers on natural language understanding benchmarks.
- Softmax attention holds an advantage for tasks requiring long context understanding.
- Converting existing Transformers into RNNs can lead to instability and poor performance when up-training large-scale models.
- Supra replaces softmax attention with a linear kernel and normalization strategy for efficient RNNs.
- Supra fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) on publicly available data after pre-training on massive proprietary datasets.
- Supra achieves competitive performance with the best linear Transformers using fewer computational resources.
- Linear Transformers replace softmax dot product attention with a general similarity function between queries and keys.
- Linear attention can be represented as an RNN, especially with causal masking.
- Linear attention allows flexibility in choosing the most suitable model for a given task and hardware.
- T2R converts pre-trained softmax Transformers into RNNs by approximating attention computation with MLPs.
- T2R requires significant retraining and may lead to a drop in performance on language benchmarks.
- Supra addresses instability in linear attention by replacing normalization with group norm.
- Modern relative positional encoding schemes like RoPE are important for competitive performance.
- Decay factors work better than no decay for short context tasks but diminish impact for long-range tasks.
- Mamba model performs best at scale compared to other models like T2R and Supra.
- Linear attention does not effectively approximate softmax attention.
- Pre-training a linear model yields better results than fine-tuning a softmax model with the same budget.
- Linear models maintain performance beyond their training context while Transformers do not.
- Simple linear scaling of positional embeddings in Transformers can allow for context scaling beyond the training window.
- Strong pre-trained Transformers may inherit biases and weaknesses from their base models.
- Future research is needed to address limitations of linear models in long-context inference tasks.
- State space models blend strengths of convolutional and recurrent models for efficient hardware use.
- SSMs face similar limitations as linear Transformers on tasks involving in-context learning and long contexts.
