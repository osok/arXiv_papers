- Mistol 7B showed a lesser decrease and a 0.6% improvement in named entity recognition.
- Masked next token prediction (MNTP) leverages bidirectional attention for better contextual understanding.
- MNTP involves masking input tokens and predicting them using past and future context.
- MNTP improved word-level task performance for S Llama 1.3B, Llama 2 to 7B, and Mistol 7B.
- Improvements in chunking task were 5%, 4%, and 4% for S Llama 1.3B, Llama 2 to 7B, and Mistol 7B.
- Unsupervised contrastive learning with Sim CSSE refines sequence representations.
