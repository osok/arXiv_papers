# IDEAS:
- Fractals are generated by iterating functions with varying hyperparameters leading to bifurcation boundaries.
- Slight variations in hyperparameters can lead to vastly different neural network training outcomes.
- The boundary between successful and unsuccessful neural network training exhibits fractal characteristics.
- Visualizing these boundaries helps understand the chaotic dependence of final loss values on hyperparameters.
- Neural network training dynamics can be compared to fractal generation processes.
- The Julia set illustrates how small changes in parameters lead to significant shifts in outcomes.
- Training a neural network involves iterating a function related to the network's parameters through gradient descent steps.
- Bifurcation boundaries in neural network training are similar to those in fractal generation.
- The study uses color coding to distinguish between converging and diverging training runs.
- High-resolution images reveal the fractal nature of the boundary between successful and unsuccessful training.
- Experiments were conducted under six different conditions to investigate the widespread nature of fractal behavior.
- The baseline condition involves using the T nonlinearity function and full batch gradient descent.
- Other conditions include using ReLU nonlinearity, identity nonlinearity, mini-batch gradient descent, and single data points.
- Fractals resulting from neural network training appear more organic with less repetition and symmetry.
- Non-homogeneity of the bifurcation boundary is a fascinating subject for further exploration.
- Reducing the learning rate for the input layer effectively trains only the readout layer.
