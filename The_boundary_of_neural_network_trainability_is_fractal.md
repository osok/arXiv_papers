# SUMMARY
The section explores fractal generation and its connection to neural network training, revealing fractal properties in hyperparameter boundaries.

# IDEAS:
- Fractals are generated by iterating functions with varying hyperparameters leading to bifurcation boundaries.
- Small changes in function parameters can lead to significant shifts in outcomes, forming critical points.
- Julia set illustrates fractal generation by iterating a complex function and observing divergence or convergence.
- Neural network training involves iterating a function related to parameters through gradient descent steps.
- Bifurcation boundaries in neural network training show slight hyperparameter variations leading to different outcomes.
- Visualizing the boundary between successful and unsuccessful neural network training reveals fractal characteristics.
- Experiments use a neural network with one hidden layer, inputs, and parameters from a standard normal distribution.
- Training involves full batch steepest gradient descent over a range of learning rates for input and output weights.
- Color coding distinguishes between converging and diverging runs, indicating loss duration and severity.
- High-resolution images visualize outcomes, revealing the fractal nature of the boundary between training results.
- Fractal-like behavior in neural network training provides insights into learning process dynamics.
- Experiments under six conditions explore widespread fractal behavior in neural network training.
- Baseline condition uses T nonlinearity function, full batch gradient descent, and grid search over learning rates.
- Effects of using ReLU nonlinearity function are explored in the second experimental condition.
- Identity nonlinearity turns the network into a deep linear network in the third condition.
- Mini-batch gradient descent with a mini-batch size of 16 is examined in the fourth condition.
- Single training data point is used in the fifth experimental condition.
- Grid search over different hyperparameters targets mean value during parameter initialization and learning rate.
- Representative images from all conditions are organized by fractal dimension with links to animations.
- Popular fractals exhibit geometric repetition and symmetry, while neural network fractals appear more organic.
- Non-homogeneity of bifurcation boundary is a subject for further exploration.
- Arbitrary selection of hyperparameter regions may lead to biased results.
- Reduced learning rate for input layer effectively trains only the readout layer, not producing fractal dynamics.
- Mini-batch training introduces stochasticity but still forms fractals, resembling Leonov fractals.
- Extending fractals to higher dimensions presents a unique challenge due to multiple hyperparameters in training.
- Meta loss landscapes are chaotic, presenting challenges in meta-learning.
