# SUMMARY
Stylus, a method for generative image models, efficiently selects and composes relevant adapters based on user prompts to enhance image quality and diversity.

# IDEAS:
- Stylus automates the process of assessing user prompts to retrieve and compose relevant adapters.
- It addresses challenges like converting adapters into lookup embeddings and segmenting user prompts.
- Stylus avoids degradation of image quality, biases, and concept overrides when composing multiple adapters.
- The system employs a three-stage framework: refine, retrieve, and compose.
- The refiner generates textual descriptions of an adapter's task and computes text embeddings.
- The retriever fetches the most relevant adapters by processing the user prompt.
- The composer segments the prompt into tasks and assigns retrieved adapters based on similarity scores.
- Stylus applies a binary mask to control the number of adapters per task.
- It ensures semantic alignment and avoids biases detrimental to image generation.
- Stylus improves visual fidelity, textual alignment, and image diversity over existing checkpoints.
- The method leverages a vision-language model, text encoders, and a composer stage.
- Stylus outperforms existing retrieval-based systems in efficiency and effectiveness.
- It filters out irrelevant adapters and those likely to introduce biases.
- Stylus applies a binary mask to control the number of adapters per task.
- The system's performance gains are demonstrated through human evaluations and automatic benchmarks.
- Stylus does not impose large overheads on the image generation process.
- It is validated through a comprehensive experimental setup using the Stylus Docs dataset.
- Evaluation includes human evaluation, automatic benchmarks, and comparisons with existing methods.
- Stylus achieved significant improvements in visual fidelity, textual alignment, and image diversity.
- It excelled in generating highly diverse images due to different composer outputs and masking schemes.
- Stylus prevailed in approximately 60% of cases for diversity metrics like DeFID and GPT-4V scores.
- Limitations include potential degradation of image quality when composing multiple adapters.
- There is a risk of introducing unwanted biases into the model.
- Controlling the number of adapters per task to ensure high image diversity is challenging.
- Further refinement and optimization are needed for consistent high-quality results.
