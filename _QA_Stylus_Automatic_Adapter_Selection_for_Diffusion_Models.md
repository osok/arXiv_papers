# SUMMARY
Stylus, a method for generative image models, efficiently selects and composes relevant adapters based on user prompts, enhancing image quality and diversity.

# IDEAS:
- Stylus automates selecting and composing relevant adapters based on user-provided prompts.
- It addresses challenges in retrieving and merging multiple low-rank adapters (Laura).
- Stylus enhances foundational models for image generation.
- It refines adapter descriptions, retrieves relevant adapters, and composes them into tasks.
- The system avoids degradation of image quality, biases, and concept overrides.
- Stylus employs a three-stage framework: refine, retrieve, and compose.
- The refiner generates textual descriptions and computes text embeddings for retrieval.
- The retriever fetches the most relevant adapters using cosine similarity scores.
- The composer segments prompts into tasks and assigns retrieved adapters based on similarity.
- A binary mask controls the number of adapters per task, promoting image diversity.
- Stylus improves visual fidelity, textual alignment, and image diversity over existing checkpoints.
- It uses a vision-language model, text encoders, and a composer stage.
- Stylus outperforms existing retrieval-based systems in adapter selection and composition.
- The system filters out irrelevant adapters and those likely to introduce biases.
- Stylus applies a binary mask to control the number of adapters per task.
- It improves efficiency and effectiveness in adapter selection and composition.
- Stylus reduces biases and increases image diversity.
- Performance gains are demonstrated through human evaluations and automatic benchmarks.
- Stylus does not impose large overheads on the image generation process.
- It is validated using a dataset called Stylus Docs with 75k Lauras.
- Evaluations include human assessments, automatic benchmarks, and comparisons with existing methods.
- Stylus achieves significant improvements in visual fidelity, textual alignment, and image diversity.
- Human evaluations show a preference for Stylus over existing model checkpoints.
- Automatic benchmarks like FID support the improvement in image quality.
- Stylus demonstrates better textual alignment with negligible differences compared to stable diffusion checkpoints.
- It excels in generating highly diverse images due to different composer outputs and masking schemes.
- Limitations include potential degradation of image quality when composing multiple adapters.
- There is a risk of introducing unwanted biases into the model.
- Controlling the number of adapters per task can be challenging.
