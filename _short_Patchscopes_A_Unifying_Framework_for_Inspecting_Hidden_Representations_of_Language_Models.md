# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Patch Scopes, a framework enhancing interpretability methods by decoding specific information from hidden representations in language models.

# IDEAS:
- Patch Scopes enhances interpretability methods with new capabilities for decoding hidden representations in language models.
- It utilizes language models to generate humanlike text, translating information encoded in hidden representations.
- Patch Scopes patches hidden representations into different inference passes of the same or different language models.
- The computation after patching reveals specific information decoded from the patched representation.
- It exposes contextualized information within hidden representations.
- Patch Scopes builds upon and extends prior interpretability methods.
- Existing methods projecting language model representations to the output vocabulary space are a class of Patch Scopes.
- Methods like logit lens, linear shortcuts, and tuned lens employ different mapping functions to inspect representations.
- The LR attribute lens method constructs mapping functions based on a relation linearity assumption.
- LR attribute lens shows effectiveness in attribute extraction.
- Patch Scopes includes methods like future lens, decoding subsequent tokens from hidden representations.
- Causal tracing uses Gaussian noise as the target prompt in Patch Scopes.
- Patch Scopes enables innovative inspection methods by modifying the target prompt.
- It allows expressive decoding of any chosen feature independent of the source prompt computation.
- Using prompts like "the capital of X is" evaluates if the capital city is extractable from hidden representations.
- The prompt "tell me facts about X" determines if the model has resolved the entity name corresponding to a description.
- Patching into a more capable model is beneficial when the inspected model cannot answer specific queries.
- Patch Scopes significantly extends interpretability methods by introducing patching hidden representations.
- It enables decoding specific information from language models.
- Patch Scopes encompasses prior methods and introduces new inspection capabilities.
- Modifying the target prompt and patching into different models improves interpretability.
- Demonstrates effectiveness in improving interpretability and achieving superior performance in querying specific information.
