# SUMMARY
The section discusses the limitations of text-only human-computer interaction with large language models (LLMs) and the need to endow LLMs with visual and audio understanding capabilities. The authors propose Video Lama, a multimodal LLM that supports video input and allows users to chat with computers around user-uploaded videos. They use a pre-trained visual encoder and audio encoder to separately compute frame representations and audio signals, respectively, and introduce a frame embedding layer and a video queue former to generate visual query tokens. They also devise a multi-branch cross-model pre-training framework to achieve both vision-language alignment and audio-language alignment.
