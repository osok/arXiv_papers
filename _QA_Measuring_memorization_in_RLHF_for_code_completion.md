# SUMMARY
The new method addresses training data memorization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RHF) for code completion models, focusing on mitigating risks of sensitive data leakage.

# IDEAS:
- The method aims to solve training data memorization in RHF for code completion models.
- It analyzes memorization risks in fine-tuning, reward model training, and RL fine-tuning stages.
- The goal is to understand when training data can be memorized, especially in sensitive areas.
- Leakage of user data in code completion raises legal, commercial, and privacy concerns.
- The method measures and mitigates potential memorization of sensitive information during training.
- It investigates how hyperparameters like KL regularization impact memorization persistence.
- The method provides insights into preventing or reducing training data memorization risks.
- RHF aligns large language models with user preferences through three main phases.
- First, the model is fine-tuned on a specific dataset for code completion.
- Second, a reward model evaluates the quality of the model's output based on human feedback.
- Third, the fine-tuned model is optimized to maximize scores assigned by the reward model.
- The model is penalized for deviating too much from its initial fine-tuned state.
- This process balances between memorization and generating diverse, contextually appropriate completions.
- Adjusting hyperparameters like KL regularization helps avoid over-optimizing on specific examples.
- Human feedback incorporation improves code completions while minimizing sensitive data memorization risks.
- Analysis of memorization at each RHF stage provides insights into training data risks.
- The method offers a systematic way to align models with user preferences while managing memorization risks.
- Validation involves measuring memorization in fine-tuning, reward model training, and RL fine-tuning phases.
- Experiments use synthetic Python datasets to measure different types of memorization.
- Results show 43-47% of examples memorized during fine-tuning persist after RL fine-tuning.
- Memorization of sensitive data in reward model training is very low (0.9%).
- Fewer than 0.5% of prompts are memorized after 70 epochs of RL fine-tuning.
- Smaller Alpha coefficients in KL regularization allow increased memorization.
- Organizations can use valuable data in reward model training without significant leakage risks.
- Limitations include potential memorization of training data at various RHF stages.
- Reliance on reward model signals may not always prevent memorization during RL fine-tuning.
- Defining and measuring memorization accurately is challenging, especially in code completion contexts.
- Hyperparameters introduce variability in memorization risk, affecting consistent results.

# INSIGHTS:

- Low memorization rates in reward model training suggest minimal sensitive data leakage risks.
- Smaller Alpha coefficients in KL regularization increase memorization risks.
- Accurate measurement and definition of memorization are crucial for effective risk management.
