# SUMMARY
The text discusses the evolution of large language models (LLMs) and their vulnerabilities, proposing a hierarchical instruction system to enhance security against various attacks.

# IDEAS:
- Modern LLMs have evolved beyond simple autocomplete systems to enable applications like web agents and virtual assistants.
- A significant concern is the potential for adversaries to manipulate LLMs into performing harmful actions.
- Prompt injection attacks on LLM-powered email assistants could lead to unauthorized access to private emails.
- Jailbreaks and prompt injections pose serious threats by bypassing security measures or exposing private data.
- The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the lack of instruction hierarchy in current LLMs.
- LLMs process different types of input, including system messages, user messages, and tool outputs.
- Existing LLMs lack the capability to prioritize messages based on their source and importance.
- Introducing a hierarchy where system messages take precedence over user messages can address this issue.
- User messages should take precedence over third-party content in the proposed hierarchy.
- The model should comply with aligned instructions and ignore or refuse misaligned ones.
- Synthetic data generation and context distillation principles are used to train the model with this hierarchy.
- Aligned instructions are decomposed into smaller tasks placed at different hierarchy levels.
- Misaligned instructions are trained to be disregarded by combining examples with various attack scenarios.
- Evaluation shows a 63% improvement in resisting system prompt extraction attacks.
- The approach generalizes to new attack types not encountered during training with over 30% improvement in jailbreak robustness.
- Over refusals exist, but further data collection can address these challenges.
- Prompt injections target applications built on models rather than the models themselves.
- Jailbreaks aim to bypass safety mechanisms trained into an LLM, enabling malicious activities.
- System message extraction attacks focus on revealing crucial information like business logic or private data.
- Establishing a hierarchy where LLMs prioritize higher privileged instructions can mitigate conflicts.
- Context synthesis breaks down aligned instructions into smaller parts placed at different hierarchy levels.
- Context ignorance trains models to predict responses as if they never saw lower-level instructions.
- Training data for misaligned scenarios involves creating instructions to reveal the system message and training the model to refuse such requests.
- Models show increased robustness and controllability even when faced with unseen prompts.

# INSIGHTS:
- Lack of instruction hierarchy in LLMs leads to vulnerabilities like prompt injections and jailbreaks.
- Introducing a hierarchical instruction system can significantly improve LLM security against various attacks.
- Synthetic data generation and context distillation are effective for training models with hierarchical instructions.
- Aligned instructions should be decomposed into smaller tasks placed at different hierarchy levels.
- Misaligned instructions should be disregarded or refused by the model to enhance security.
- Evaluation shows significant improvement in resisting system prompt extraction attacks with hierarchical training.
- The approach generalizes well to new attack types not encountered during training.
- Prompt injections target applications built on models rather than the models themselves.
- Jailbreaks enable malicious activities by bypassing safety mechanisms trained into an LLM.
- System message extraction attacks reveal crucial information like business logic or private data.
