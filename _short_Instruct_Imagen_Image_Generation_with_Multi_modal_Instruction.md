# SUMMARY
The paper introduces diffusion models for image generation, proposing a multimodal instruction format and the Instruct Imagine model to enhance image generation tasks.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models are latent variable models parameterized by Theta.
- These models learn image distribution by reversing the diffusion Markov chain.
- A Time reweighted Square error loss is proposed to denoise latent images.
- The training dataset contains pairs of image conditions and original images.
- A format allowing generalization and integration of multimodal information is needed.
- A multimodal instruction format is proposed for image generation tasks.
- The format includes a payload text instruction describing the task objective.
- It also includes a multimodal context with marker plus text-image pairs.
- A shared instruction understanding model consumes both text instruction and multimodal context.
- Instruct Imagine extends a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.
- The model is fully conditioned on the input multimodal instruction.
- It generates 128x resolution images from text prompts.
- A text-conditioned super-resolution model scales resolution up to 1024x images.
- The backbone model is a convolutional UNet with downsampling encoder and upsampling decoder.
- Multimodal instruction is encoded using a pre-trained text-to-image model.
- A cross-attention layer conditions the bottleneck representation on embedded multimodal context.
- The training pipeline has two stages: retrieval augmented training and multimodal instruction tuning.
- Retrieval augmented training conditions on relevant but non-duplicated neighboring multimodal context.
- Training data is constructed by clustering web-scale image-text pairs.
- One pair is sampled as input target, three others as multimodal context.
- Multimodal instruction tuning fine-tunes on diverse image generation tasks with corresponding instructions.
- The model is optimized end-to-end in both training stages.

# INSIGHTS:
- Diffusion models reverse the diffusion Markov chain to learn image distribution effectively.
- Multimodal instruction format integrates text and image data for better generalization.
- Instruct Imagine leverages pre-trained models for enhanced image resolution and quality.
- Cross-attention layers improve conditioning on multimodal contexts in image generation.
- Retrieval augmented training ensures relevant context without duplication, enhancing model performance.
