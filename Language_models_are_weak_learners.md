# SUMMARY
The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) as weak learners in a boosting framework for tabular data classification. By converting tabular data to text and using LLMs to summarize examples, a template is generated for classification. This approach outperforms zero-shot, few-shot, and traditional methods without retraining the LLM.
