# SUMMARY
The paper introduces Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD), a framework for conditional generation using pre-trained diffusion models, improving sample quality and efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- Conditional generation is crucial in generative modeling but faces cost and generalizability challenges.
- Diffusion models use standard loss functions to guide sampling without extra training.
- Diffusion models can be slow due to extensive sampling time and optimization steps.
- Manifold hypothesis suggests real data lies on a small underlying manifold, not the entire pixel space.
- MPGD uses pre-trained diffusion models for conditional generation with minimal additional computation.
- MPGD projects guidance to the manifold throughout the diffusion process, improving sample quality.
- MPGD achieves high sample quality and generalizability across various tasks.
- Training-free guided diffusion decomposes conditional score functions into unconditional score functions and loss-based terms.
- Optimization within the neighborhood of denoised samples may deviate from the manifold, leading to suboptimal results.
- MPGD uses autoencoders to estimate tangent spaces of data manifolds for manifold-preserving guidance.
- Well-trained imperfect autoencoders can effectively map guidance to the data manifold.
- MPGD with latent diffusion models (LDMs) manipulates latents using autoencoder latent space.
- Multi-step optimization can improve both quality and speed of the diffusion process.
- MPGD outperforms baselines in fidelity and sample quality across various tasks.
- FaceID guidance generates human face images closely resembling reference faces.
- MPGD shows significant speed improvements compared to benchmark methods.
- MPGD can guide in tangent spaces of DDIM samples, altering only relevant semantics.
- Text-to-image style guided generation balances text prompts and style guidance.
- MPGD provides significant speed-up and fits into a 16 GB GPU, unlike other methods.
- MPGD framework is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of conditional generation tasks.
- The manifold hypothesis is key to improving sample quality in low-resource settings.
