# SUMMARY
This section explores the challenges of pre-training large language models (LLMs) and the impact of data quality and coverage on their efficiency.

# IDEAS:
- Pre-training LLMs is resource-intensive, involving training huge Transformer models on trillions of text tokens.

- The Llama 65b model aligns more closely with human preferences when trained on 1,000 fine-tuning prompts.
- Data-efficient pre-training showed a 6.7B model converging 20% faster using stratified cluster sampling.
- Data curation at a human expert level allows models to surpass baselines up to 25 times larger.
- Data curation involves selecting training samples based on quality, coverage, or both.
- Simple heuristics like maximum coverage may suffice for pre-training state-of-the-art LLMs.
- Improving data curation algorithms can enhance the tradeoff between data quantity and model quality.
- Data curation opens new tradeoffs between training time, inference cost, data collection effort, and performance.
- Large-scale analyses of data pruning strategies are scarce due to extreme computational demands.
- Ask LLM sampler prioritizes high-quality and informative training samples by consulting a proxy LLM.
- Density sampler aims to maximize the coverage of latent topics in the dataset through diversified sampling.
- Ask LLM can train better models even after removing up to 90% of training samples.
- Implemented 19 different sampling strategies for pre-training T5 models on 524 billion tokens.
- Quality-focused sampling like Ask LLM can outperform traditional methods in enhancing LLM pre-training outcomes.
- Coverage sampling maximizes diversity by choosing points spread across the entire input space.
- Quality score sampling assigns scores to examples based on perceived quality for preferential selection.
- Ask LLM requires running an LLM inference for each training sample, making it resource-intensive.
