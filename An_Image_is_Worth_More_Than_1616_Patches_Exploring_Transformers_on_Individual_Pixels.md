# SUMMARY
The text discusses the evolution of deep learning in computer vision, focusing on removing inductive biases like locality in models such as Vision Transformers (ViT) and introducing the Pixel Transformer (PiT) for improved performance.

# IDEAS:
- Deep learning revolutionized computer vision by learning features directly from data, not manually crafted.
- Reducing model preferences creates systems that work well across different tasks and data types.
- The Vision Transformer (ViT) has fewer image-specific biases compared to older models like ConvNets.
- Removing locality bias in ViT led to the development of the Pixel Transformer (PiT).
- PiT treats each pixel as a separate piece of information, improving results without traditional image grid structure.
- PiT challenges the idea that nearby pixels are crucial for visual tasks.
- PiT performed well in object classification and image generation compared to locality-reliant models.
- PiT may not be as practical as ViT due to computational demands.
- Removing locality bias could shape future developments in image processing architectures.
- Early attempts to remove locality in ConvNets involved replacing spatial filters with one-by-one filters.
- Transformers excel in handling all-to-all communications through the self-attention mechanism.
- The IGP model aimed for locality-free self-supervised pixel prediction but fell short in performance.
- Perceiver architecture operates directly on pixels and employs latent Transformers with cross-attention modules.
- Perceiver aims to be modality agnostic but hasn't gained as much traction as traditional Transformers.
- ConvNets exhibit locality bias in receptive fields where neighboring pixels hold more significance.
- ViTs incorporate designs like patchification and position embedding to retain some level of locality bias.
- Position embeddings can introduce locality biases by assuming nearby tokens are more similar.
- PiT removes remaining locality bias in ViT by processing pixels as an unordered set with learnable position embeddings.
- PiT uses one-by-one patches instead of 16-by-16, simplifying the ViT model.
- Treating pixels as tokens reduces vocabulary size compared to patch-based approaches like ViT.
- PiT can be computationally expensive for long sequences but shows promise for future practical deployment.
- PiT performs best when input size is fixed and patch size is decreased, emphasizing sequence length importance.
- Self-supervised pre-training with MAE enhances accuracy for PiT compared to training from scratch.
- PiT may have better scalability potential than ViT, especially when transitioning from tiny to small models.
- Diffusion Transformer (DiT) features a modulation-based architecture different from standard ViT for image generation tasks.
- DiT operates on latent token space from VQG, reducing input size by a factor of eight.
- PiT L outperformed baseline DL2 model in image generation tasks with competitive FID scores.
- Maintaining translation equivariance is important after compromising locality in models like PiT.
