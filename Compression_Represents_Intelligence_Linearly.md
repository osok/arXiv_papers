- Limited empirical evidence exists on the connection between compression and intelligence.
- The study aims to fill this gap by investigating if better compression indicates higher intelligence.
- Intelligence is defined practically, focusing on model performance in various tasks.
- Intelligence is measured based on knowledge, common sense, coding, and mathematical reasoning.
- Raw data from different domains is gathered to evaluate LLMs' compression efficiency.
- A strong linear correlation exists between LLMs' compression efficiency and downstream task performance.
- Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately -0.95 found for each intelligence domain evaluated.
- Superior compression is indicative of greater intelligence in LLMs.
- Using compression efficiency as a metric can help prevent overfitting and test contamination.
- Diverse LLMs created using different training data, tokenizers, computation methods, and architectures are evaluated.
- Universal intelligence focuses on an agent's ability to achieve goals across various scenarios.
- Average bits per character (BPC) is used as a metric to gauge compression efficiency.
- Consistency in model evaluation is ensured by standardizing context window sizes.
- Base models are focused on rather than fine-tuned models to avoid specialization bias.
- Different corpora highlight different aspects of models' abilities.
- Min K per prob method detects potential data exposure during pre-training.
- Eight series of general-purpose language models are evaluated alongside dense transformer models.
- Mixture of experts (MoE) architecture is introduced in the form of Mixt 8X 7B model.
- Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.94 and RMSE of 2.8% found between average benchmark scores and BPC.
- Linear correlation observed between individual benchmark scores and compression efficiency.
- Differences in linear correlation among benchmarks attributed to performance saturation and dataset mismatch.
- DeepSea Coder models consistently outperformed the linear fit due to task-specific data exposure during pre-training.
- Quin model series achieved higher accuracies than predicted due to specific training and test data exposure.
- Strong linear correlation challenges the notion that individual scores are too noisy to reflect general model ability.
- Mismatch between compression corpus and benchmarks weakens linear correlation.
- Tens of millions of characters in a compression corpus are sufficiently large for reliable BPC computation.
- Mixed corpus combining coding and mathematical reasoning showed stronger linear correlation than using either corpus alone.
- Better compression reflects higher intelligence, suggesting compression efficiency as a reliable metric for evaluating LLMs.
