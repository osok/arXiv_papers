# SUMMARY
The section discusses the challenges of high latency in diffusion models for image synthesis and proposes a one-step text-to-image model called Diffusion 2GAN, which combines diffusion models and GANs to improve speed and quality.

# IDEAS:
- Diffusion models require many sampling steps, leading to high latency in image generation.
- A one-step text-to-image model can enhance user experience and broaden applications in 3D and video contexts.
- Training text-to-image GANs on large datasets is challenging due to complex tasks.
- Establishing correspondence between noises and images is crucial for effective image synthesis.
- Using a pre-trained diffusion model to simulate an OD solver helps establish noise-image pairs.
- Conditional GANs can map noises to images in a paired image-to-image translation framework.
- Disentangling tasks allows leveraging strengths of both generative models.
- Perceptual losses like LPIPS preserve important details better than point-based losses like L2.
- Latent LPIPS enables perceptual losses to work directly in latent space, increasing batch size.
- Ensembled latent LPIPS improves performance in latent space with just a regression loss.
- Diffusion 2GAN distills stable diffusion 1.5 into a single-step conditional GAN model.
- Diffusion 2GAN outperforms other distillation methods on benchmarks like COCO 2014.
- Diffusion 2GAN shows effectiveness in distilling larger models like SDXL.
- The method extends beyond latent space diffusion models to pixel space models.
- Paired noise-to-image translation simplifies the multi-step diffusion process into a single step.
- E-latent LPIPS improves convergence and reduces computation time and memory consumption.
- Single sample R1 regularization improves training stability and convergence.
- Mix and match augmentation encourages better text alignment and noise conditioning.
- Diffusion 2GAN achieves superior FID scores compared to other distillation methods.
- DreamDiv metric measures image diversity by considering average pairwise perceptual distance.
- Diffusion 2GAN generates more diverse images than SDXL Turbo and exhibits plausible structural features.
- The method has limitations, such as simulating a fixed classifier-free guidance scale.
