# SUMMARY
The text discusses the integration of large language models (LLMs) in information retrieval (IR) systems, introducing a benchmark (FOLWIIR) to evaluate instruction-following capabilities.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) have improved semantic search but still rely on basic keywords.
- Information retrieval (IR) systems benefit from LLMs but need better instruction-following capabilities.
- FOLWIIR is a benchmark to assess how well retrieval models follow complex instructions.
- Current IR models often treat instructions as simple keywords rather than defining relevance.
- Transitioning to advanced search with instructions can help experts pinpoint complex information needs.
- FOLWIIR includes diverse and realistic training data to enhance instruction-following abilities.
- The benchmark uses three extensively annotated TR collections: TRC Robust 2004, TRC Common Core 2017, and TRC News 2021.
- A new evaluation framework, PMRR, measures changes in document rankings with different instructions.
- Current models struggle with instruction-following unless specifically trained for retrieval tasks.
- Models are not accustomed to lengthy instructions and often misinterpret them as keywords.
- Fine-tuning models on real-world instructions improves their understanding and performance.
- FOLWIIR aims to bridge the gap in instruction-following research in IR systems.
- Instruction-following research has gained popularity with models like GPT-3.
- Early works trained retrieval models to use short instructions; recent efforts integrate longer ones.
- There is a lack of explicit benchmarks for instruction-related retrieval evaluation.
- MS MARCO collection is another dataset proposed for evaluating instruction-based retrieval models.
- FOLWIIR focuses on highly judged corpora, human-generated instructions, and validated relevance judgments.
- Expert annotators modify TR instructions to test model responses to subtle changes.
- The ranking approach ensures fair evaluation despite differing retrieval outcomes.
- Standard retrieval metrics include Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
- PMRR is a novel pairwise evaluation metric focusing on rank changes with modified instructions.
- Models trained without instructions generally have negative PMRR scores.
- API embedding models perform well in standard IR metrics but struggle with instruction-following.
- Instruction-tuned LLMs show positive results for following instructions but vary widely in performance.
- Larger parameter models or those explicitly trained for instructions perform better.
- Models struggle with longer instructions but improve with keywords and shorter instructions.
- Fine-tuning on longer instructions enhances model performance in following instructions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Transitioning to advanced search with detailed instructions can significantly improve information retrieval accuracy.
- Current IR models often misinterpret complex instructions as simple keywords, limiting their effectiveness.
- Fine-tuning LLMs on real-world, longer instructions can enhance their instruction-following capabilities.
- Instruction-following ability in LLMs improves with scale and specific training for retrieval tasks.
- Evaluating IR models with diverse and realistic training data is crucial for better performance.
