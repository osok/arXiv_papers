# SUMMARY
The text discusses the integration of large language models (LLMs) in information retrieval (IR) systems, introducing a benchmark (FOLWIIR) to evaluate instruction-following capabilities.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models have improved semantic search but still rely on basic keywords.
- Transitioning to advanced search with instructions can help pinpoint complex information needs.
- FOLWIIR benchmark assesses how well retrieval models follow complex instructions.
- Current models struggle with lengthy instructions and treat them as simple keywords.
- Training data based on real-world instructions enhances model understanding.
- FOLWIIR includes a new evaluation framework, PMRR, to measure changes in document rankings.
- Models not trained for retrieval tasks struggle with instruction following.
- Instruction-following ability improves with model scale and specific training.
- Models perform better with keywords and shorter instructions than longer ones.
- Fine-tuning on longer instructions enhances model performance in following instructions.
- FOLWIIR leverages existing TRC collections for evaluation.
- PMRR focuses on measuring score differences when following modified instructions.
- Standard IR metrics include mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).
- API models perform well in standard IR metrics but poorly in instruction following.
- Instruction-tuned LLMs show positive results for following instructions.
- Larger parameter models or those trained to follow instructions perform well.
- Models use instructions for keyword matching and struggle with less relevant information.
- Fine-tuning on longer instructions improves both standard IR metrics and instruction following.
- FOLWIIR aims to test and improve models' instruction-following capabilities in retrieval tasks.
- Incorporating specific aspects and negation in instructions tests model adaptability.
- Evaluating various IR models reveals gaps in instruction-following performance.

# INSIGHTS:

- Models not accustomed to lengthy instructions often treat them as simple keywords.
- Instruction-following ability improves significantly with model scale and specific training.
- Fine-tuning on longer instructions enhances both standard IR metrics and instruction following.
- Incorporating specific aspects and negation in instructions tests model adaptability.
