# SUMMARY
The new method aims to improve large language models' alignment with human preferences using implicit rewards from direct preference optimization (DPO) training.

# IDEAS:
- The method enhances LLMs' alignment with human preferences using implicit rewards from DPO training.
- It proposes a bootstrapping approach using implicit rewards to rank outputs and construct new preference datasets.
- Practical issues like length exploitation and over-reliance on implicit rewards are addressed with length-regularized reward shaping.
- Experience replay is used to leverage high-quality human preference data from initial DPO rounds.
- The iterative process fine-tunes the policy model without external feedback, simplifying training.
- The DICE method stands for self-alignment with DPO implicit rewards.
- Implicit rewards are used iteratively to improve language model alignment quality.
- A mixture of generated and offline preference data prevents catastrophic forgetting.
- Length-regularized reward shaping discourages long responses and prevents length exploitation.
- The method balances old and new data to maintain performance.
- Training involves evaluating performance on Alpaca Val 2.0 and comparing results with baseline methods.
- Ablation studies investigate the effects of length-regularized reward shaping and experience replay.
- Limitations include reliance on well-trained implicit reward models and potential model collapse.
- Future research explores rewarding capabilities of other DPO variants for continuous improvement.
- Implicit rewards allow continual enhancement without external feedback, unlike offline DPO.
- Self-rewarding LM may suffer from coarse rewards, unlike DICE's effective preference signals.
- Implicit rewards in bootstrapping address length exploitation and catastrophic forgetting.
- The method ensures a balanced mix of high-quality offline and on-policy generated data.
- Data sets are constructed by sampling responses and incorporating length-regularized reward shaping.
- Length regularization penalizes verbose responses, ensuring concise outputs.
- Experiments showed significant performance improvements on Alpaca Val 2.0.
- DICE outperformed Gemini Pro without additional human annotations or external reward models.
- Future research addresses model collapse and continuous improvement over iterations.
