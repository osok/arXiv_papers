# SUMMARY
The text discusses estimating hallucination rates in in-context learning (ICL) using conditional generative models (CGMs) and large language models (LLMs).

# IDEAS:
- Conditional generative models (CGMs) are sequential models with parameters defining distributions.
- Large language models (LLMs) are CGMs with large parameter sizes operating over linguistic units.
- In-context learning (ICL) involves a model, dataset, and query to generate responses.
- Bayesian perspective links ICL to Bayesian statistics, assuming a joint distribution over query-response pairs.
- Pre-trained language models approximate the posterior predictive distribution under this joint distribution.
- Posterior hallucination rate (PHR) estimates the probability of generating errors in response to a query.
- Sampling from the predictive distribution of the CGM computes the PHR.
- Hallucinations are values unlikely to be generated from the true mechanism.
- True hallucination rate (TH) is the probability of sampling a hallucination given the true mechanism and query.
- PHR is the probability that a value falls outside the high probability interval of the posterior predictive distribution.
- Estimators for PHR use Monte Carlo estimates for integrals and quantiles.
- Predictive resampling for hallucination rate estimation calculates the outer integral in the equation.
- PHR estimator predicts the true hallucination rate (TH) accurately in synthetic regression experiments.
- PHR estimator performs better for smaller dataset sizes.
- PHR estimator predicts the model's hallucination rate and empirical error rate in natural language tasks.
- PHR estimator's accuracy improves with an increasing number of examples.
- PHR closely aligns with TH but tends to underestimate it with more examples.
- Model hallucination probability (MHP) compares against hallucination rate in natural language tasks.
- MHP estimates the probability of hallucination when additional ground truth examples are included.
- Comparison between PHR and MHP shows promising results for certain tasks.
- Discrepancies between model and true distribution can lead to underestimation of hallucination rates.
- Future research needed to enhance robustness of estimation method or optimize CGMs for ICL.
