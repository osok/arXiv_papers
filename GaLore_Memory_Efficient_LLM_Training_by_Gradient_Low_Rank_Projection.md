- Galore allows switching across low-rank subspaces to adapt to changing principal subspaces.
- The frequency of subspace changes impacts algorithm performance.
- Galore introduces only a few additional hyperparameters, making it easy to integrate.
- Galore can be applied to various optimizers like Adam and Adafactor.
