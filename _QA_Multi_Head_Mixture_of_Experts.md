# SUMMARY
The Multi-Head Mixture of Experts (MH Mo) method, proposed to address limitations in Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMOE) models, enhances expert activation and fine-grained analytical capabilities.

# IDEAS:
- MH Mo addresses low expert activation and lack of fine-grained analytical capabilities in SMOE models.
- MH Mo activates a higher percentage of experts during optimization and inference.
- The multi-head mechanism splits each token into sub-tokens distributed to different experts.
- MH Mo focuses on information from various representation spaces within different experts.
- The method achieves a more granular understanding of subtle differences in vision and language patterns.
- MH Mo aims to enhance model performance by achieving denser expert activation.
- The TSM operation splits each token into sub-tokens and routes them to specific experts.
- TSM merges outputs back into the original token form after processing.
- MH Mo captures diverse semantic information from different representation spaces within experts.
- The multi-head mechanism in MH Mo enables denser expert activation.
- MH Mo achieves up to 90.71% activation compared to 8.33% in SMOE.
- The multi-head mechanism allows for a finer-grained understanding ability.
- Sub-tokens are distributed to different experts for joint attention to various representation spaces.
- The multi-head mechanism facilitates seamless integration of sub-tokens into the original token form.
- MH Mo can be easily integrated with other SMOE optimization methods.
- The training objective of MH Mo includes an auxiliary load balancing loss.
- The auxiliary load balancing loss addresses expert load imbalance.
- Traditional SMOE load balancing focuses on maintaining constant computational demand.
- MH Mo optimizes expert activation more effectively than traditional SMOE approaches.
- In English-focused language modeling, MH Mo achieved the best performance with significant gains.
- In multilingual language modeling, MH Mo outperformed X Mo with notable gains.
- In massed multimodal modeling, MH Mo surpassed X Mo in visual question answering, visual reasoning, and image captioning tasks.
- MH Mo demonstrated superior performance across multiple downstream tasks in different domains.
