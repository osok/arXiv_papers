# SUMMARY
The study investigates the robustness and sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to layerwise interventions, focusing on deletion and swapping of layers during inference.

# IDEAS:
- The new method aims to understand robustness and sensitivity of LLMs to layerwise interventions.
- Focuses on deletion and swapping of entire layers during inference in LLMs.
- Investigates roles of different depths in the network, identifying four universal stages of inference.
- Four stages: tokenization, feature engineering, prediction ensembling, and residual sharpening.
- Interventions on GPT-2 and Pythia models reveal insights into token processing and predictions.
- Provides a framework for understanding mechanisms underlying reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
- Method involves deleting or swapping adjacent layers to understand network depth roles.
- Tokenization integrates local context to convert raw token representations into coherent entities.
- Feature engineering builds feature representations based on token context, increasing probing accuracy.
- Prediction ensembling emphasizes relevant predictions while suppressing others, marked by high MLP computation.
- Residual sharpening transitions tokens from semantic representations to specific next-token predictions.
- Experiments measure KL Divergence, relative accuracy, and change in entropy to assess interventions.
- Intervening on first and last layers has catastrophic effects on model performance.
- Middle layers are remarkably robust to deletion and minor order changes.
- Comparing layer swapping and ablation provides insights into component importance at different depths.
- Theoretical benefits include improved model interpretability and performance.
- Practical benefits include fine-tuning language models for specific tasks by targeting different inference stages.
- Method advances NLP by enhancing robustness and performance of LLMs.
- Validated by applying drop and swap interventions to every layer of GPT-2 and Pythia models.
- Results show first layer interventions cause high entropy predictions; last layer swaps also catastrophic.
- Middle layers preserve predictions despite interventions, showing robustness.
- Swapping adjacent layers is less harmful than ablating layers, indicating commutative operations.
- Identified four universal stages of inference supported by evidence from interventions.
- Case studies reveal mechanisms like attention heads constructing multi-token words.
- Limitations include inability to pinpoint specific reasons for differences between GPT and Pythia models.
- Future work should address causes of differences between models and explore stages using sparse autoencoders.
