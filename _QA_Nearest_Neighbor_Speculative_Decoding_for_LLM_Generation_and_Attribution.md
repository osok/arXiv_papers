# SUMMARY
The Nea Neighbor Speculative Decoding (Nest) method, presented in the paper, addresses hallucination in language models by enhancing evidence-based reasoning and improving content generation quality and latency.

# IDEAS:
- Nest addresses hallucination in language models, especially with longtail knowledge less represented in training data.
- It enhances evidence-based and situated reasoning by incorporating real-world text spans into language model generations.
- Nest improves content generation quality and latency by extending the standard nnlm approach.
- It conducts an additional passage retrieval step to limit the need to store and search all tokens.
- Nest offers a balanced trade-off between search accuracy and efficiency through dynamic span selection.
- It uses content-based interpolation with a relative retrieval conance score to measure token retriever uncertainty.
- The interpolation coefficient allows dynamic adaptation of the language model's output to different tasks.
- Inspired by the copy generator Cog, Nest extends context by selecting spans containing tokens from the corpus.
- Relaxed speculative decoding controls adaptive span length, revising NR by upper bounding acceptance probability.
- Parallelized relaxed speculative decoding improves efficiency and maintains or accelerates generation speed.
- Nest demonstrates superior performance in free-form generation tasks like question answering and text completion.
- It provides better attribution at a span level, ensuring accurate and reliable information retrieval.
- Nest generates multiple tokens at each time step, speeding up inference time without compromising fluency.
- Dynamic adaptation to downstream tasks through content interpolation enhances generation quality and attribution.
- Experiments validate Nest's performance on tasks like text completion, question answering, and fact verification.
- Evaluation uses Llama 2 chap models under zero-shot settings to simulate realistic model usage.
- Metrics like perplexity, Rouge scores, FSC re hit at one, and macro accuracy assess Nest's performance.
- Results show Nest outperforms base LMS and nnlm on most tasks, demonstrating superior quality and latency.
- Detailed analysis of latency accuracy trade-off and qualitative results further validate Nest's effectiveness.
- Specific results include superior performance in text completion on Wikitext 103 with lowest complexity.
- In question answering tasks, Nest works better for smaller models (7B and 13B) and outperforms base LMS.
- Combination with retrieval augmentation shows improved performance for the 70B model in fact verification tasks.
- Consistently outperforms base LMS and in-context retrieval methods in truthful QA, handling adversarial datasets.
- Limitations include potential factual errors depending on passage and token retrieval accuracy.
- As a plug-and-play method, Nest may not be optimal without further fine-tuning of integrated systems.
- Semi-parametric LMS like Nest may struggle with in-context learning due to misalignment with database contexts.
- Preliminary experiments suggest neuro retrievers may need query reformulation for effective few-shot information processing.
