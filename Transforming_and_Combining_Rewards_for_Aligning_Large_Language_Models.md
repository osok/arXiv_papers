# SUMMARY
The paper explores aligning large language models to bias their outputs towards desired properties such as being helpful, harmless, factual, or creative. It focuses on the two-stage approach of learning a reward model from human preferences and aligning the language model to produce high-reward outputs. The main idea is to interpret alignment probabilistically, transforming the learned reward using a sigmoid function, which leads to practical benefits in encouraging the model to improve poorly performing prompts and in combining multiple reward models.
