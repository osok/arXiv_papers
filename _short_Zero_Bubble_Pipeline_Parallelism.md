# SUMMARY
The paper proposes a three-phase approach to pipeline scheduling, introducing memory-efficient zb1 and zb2 schedules, and algorithms for optimal scheduling.

# IDEAS:
- A three-phase approach to pipeline scheduling includes warm-up, steady state, and final phases.
- The warm-up phase involves increasing forward passes to distribute workload and prepare the pipeline.
- In the steady state phase, workers alternate between forward and backward passes for even workload distribution.
- The final phase processes backward passes for outstanding micro batches to complete the batch efficiently.
- The zb1 schedule adjusts starting points of W passes based on warm-up micro batches.
- The zb2 schedule achieves zero bubble by adding more F passes during warm-up and reordering W passes.
- Quantitative analysis compares peak activations memory and bubble size for different schedules.
- Algorithms for automatic pipeline scheduling search for optimal schedules based on stages, micro batches, memory, and time.
- The heuristic algorithm schedules F passes in the warm-up phase.
- An alternative mechanism bypasses synchronizations in the optimizer step while maintaining synchronous optimization semantics.
- Post-update validation replaces beforehand synchronizations, reducing latencies in the pipeline stream.
- Memory efficiency is a key focus in the zb1 and zb2 schedules.
- Sequential dependency between forward and backward passes is maintained in the steady state phase.
- The final phase ensures all micro batches are processed efficiently.
- The zb2 schedule eliminates all bubbles in the pipeline.
- Peak activations memory is analyzed for B and W passes.
- The heuristic algorithm optimizes pipeline scheduling based on given constraints.
- Synchronization bypassing reduces latencies without compromising optimization semantics.
- The zb1 schedule is designed to be memory efficient by adjusting W pass starting points.
- The zb2 schedule introduces more F passes during warm-up for zero bubble scheduling.
- Automatic pipeline scheduling algorithms consider memory limits and running time estimations.
- The proposed approach aims to maintain an even workload distribution throughout the pipeline phases.
- The final phase focuses on processing backward passes for outstanding micro batches.
- The zb1 and zb2 schedules are compared for their memory efficiency and bubble elimination capabilities.
