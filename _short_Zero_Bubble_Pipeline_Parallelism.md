# SUMMARY
The paper proposes a three-phase approach to pipeline scheduling, introducing memory-efficient zb1 and zb2 schedules, and algorithms for optimal scheduling.

# IDEAS:
- A three-phase approach to pipeline scheduling includes warm-up, steady state, and final phases.
- Warm-up phase involves increasing forward passes to distribute workload and prepare the pipeline.
- Steady state phase alternates between forward and backward passes for even workload distribution.
- Final phase processes backward passes for outstanding micro batches to complete the batch efficiently.
- zb1 schedule adjusts starting points of backward passes based on warm-up micro batches.
- zb2 schedule achieves zero bubble schedule by adding more forward passes during warm-up.
- zb2 reorders backward passes to eliminate all bubbles in the pipeline.
- Quantitative analysis compares peak activations memory and bubble size for different schedules.
- Algorithms for automatic pipeline scheduling search for optimal schedules based on various parameters.
- Heuristic algorithm schedules forward passes in the warm-up phase.
- Alternative mechanism bypasses synchronizations in optimizer step while maintaining synchronous optimization semantics.
- Post-update validation replaces beforehand synchronizations, reducing latencies in the pipeline stream.
- Memory efficiency is a key focus in zb1 and zb2 schedules.
- Sequential dependency between forward and backward passes is maintained in steady state phase.
- The final phase ensures all micro batches are processed efficiently.
- The proposed approach aims to optimize memory usage and reduce latency.
- Automatic pipeline scheduling algorithms consider pipeline stages, micro batches, memory limit, and running time.
- The heuristic algorithm is designed to optimize the warm-up phase specifically.
- Synchronization bypass mechanism aims to streamline the optimizer step.
- The paper provides a detailed quantitative analysis of different scheduling methods.
