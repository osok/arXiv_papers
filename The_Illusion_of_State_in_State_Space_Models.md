# SUMMARY
Recent research reveals that Transformer models struggle with sequential computations and state tracking tasks, unlike simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs). State space model (SSM) architectures, proposed as alternatives, also face similar limitations.

# IDEAS:

- Simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) handle state tracking tasks effortlessly.
- State space model (SSM) architectures aim to match RNNs in stateful and sequential problems.
- Linear and Mamba-style SSMs struggle with inherently sequential problems.
- Both Transformers and SSMs fail to learn permutation composition with a fixed number of layers.
- Arguments favoring SSMs over Transformers for state tracking are unfounded.
- SSMs are fundamentally limited in state tracking and recurrent computation.
- Linear SSMs belong to a specific complexity class, limiting their sequential problem-solving ability.
- SSMs may struggle with real-world state tracking challenges like chess playing and code evaluation.
- Linear SSMs cannot replicate the recurrent behavior of RNNs under realistic conditions.
- Both Transformers and SSMs face challenges in solving permutation composition state tracking problems.
- SSMs encounter difficulties in less complex state tracking tasks compared to RNNs.
- Enhancements to linear SSMs can boost their expressive power in state tracking.
- Enhancements to SSMs may affect parallelism and learning dynamics.
- Finite precision data types limit the expressive power of neural architectures.
- Log precision floating point models satisfy necessary properties for efficient parallel computation.
- Certain problems are inherently sequential and cannot be solved by Transformers.
- State tracking involves updating the world state based on a sequence of instructions.
- State tracking can be viewed as a word problem on a finite monoid.
- The complexity of a state tracking problem depends on the algebraic structure of the underlying monoid.
- Chess state tracking is six number six complete, indicating high complexity.
- Convolutional form of an SSM can be simulated in two number two complexity class.
- SSMs cannot solve inherently sequential problems despite appearing to have recurrence and statefulness.
- Matrix powering is crucial for reducing the convolutional form of an SSM to matrix powering.
- Adding nonlinearity to SSMs transforms them into RNN-like models.
- Input-dependent transition matrices create weighted finite automaton (WFA) SSMs with enhanced expressivity.
- WFA SSMs can recognize a broader range of languages than traditional SSMs.
- Practical feasibility of advanced SSM variants raises concerns about parallelism and learning dynamics.
- Learning dynamics of WFA SSMs may face issues with vanishing gradients.
- Models need dynamic depth that increases with input length to solve complex word problems effectively.
