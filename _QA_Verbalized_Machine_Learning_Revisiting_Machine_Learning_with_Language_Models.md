# SUMMARY
The proposed Verbalized Machine Learning (VML) framework, presented in the text, aims to enhance interpretability and incorporate inductive bias in machine learning by using natural language as model parameters.

# IDEAS:
- VML leverages natural language for human-interpretable model descriptions and easy incorporation of prior knowledge.

- VML treats both data and model parameters as part of the text prompt, enhancing problem-solving capabilities.
- VML aims to revolutionize traditional machine learning with a unified, interpretable framework for model training.
- Traditional numerical models remain black boxes, while VML uses human-interpretable text prompts.
- VML allows for easy tracing of model failures and incorporation of inductive bias through natural language.
- VML provides a unified token-based representation, unlike numerical models that differentiate data and parameters.
- Natural language allows easy inclusion of prior knowledge and inductive bias into the model training process.
- VML's transparency allows for easy observation and understanding of model decisions and updates during training.
