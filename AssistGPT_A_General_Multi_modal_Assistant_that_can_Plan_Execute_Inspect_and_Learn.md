# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the limitations of single large language models (LLMs) in AI assistance and proposes a solution of integrating multiple domain experts to tackle complex tasks. The proposed multimodal AI assistance system named Assist GPT uses interleaved language and code reasoning method and consists of four parts: planner, executor, inspector, and learner. The system integrates 10+ tools for different functions and can accomplish a wide range of multimodal tasks including processing complex images and long-form videos, understanding high-level queries, and handling flexible inputs.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs struggle with understanding visual environments and comprehending complex tasks.
- Combining efforts of multiple domain experts can manage more complex tasks.
- Language-based planning uses an LLM to manage cooperation of expert models.
- Code-based planning leverages codecs to write Python code for visual-related APIs.
- Assist GPT combines flexible reasoning in React and robust tool invocation in program-based planning.
- The planner in Assist GPT uses formatted code to invoke external models.
- The executor ensures uniform input and output format across all external tools.
- The inspector provides summaries and metadata of all available visual materials.
- The learner checks the reasonableness of the prediction process and correctness of results.
- Assist GPT integrates over 10 different tools for various multimodal tasks.
- Assist GPT can handle complex images, long-form videos, high-level queries, and flexible inputs.
- Pre-training LLMs to use visual elements as conditional inputs is one strategy for multimodal systems.
- Combining multiple models or tools for complex multimodal reasoning is another strategy.
- Compositional reasoning breaks down questions into smaller tasks handled by specific modules.
- Early modular models used end-to-end reinforcement learning for training.
- Toolformer offers a self-supervised approach optimizing planning with few examples for each API.
- Assist GPT uses a simpler mechanism guiding the system to retry tasks and preserve successful attempts.
- The planner in Assist GPT uses GPT-4 for global reasoning and planning.
- The executor validates, executes, and post-processes code generated by the planner.
- The inspector manages visual inputs and intermediary results, assisting the planner.
- The learner self-assesses and verifies output reasonableness, encouraging repeated attempts until success.
