# SUMMARY
The paper discusses the limitations of single large language models (LLMs) in AI assistance and proposes a solution of integrating multiple domain experts to tackle complex tasks. The proposed multimodal AI assistance system, named Assist GPT, uses an interleaved language and code reasoning method and consists of four parts: planner, executor, inspector, and learner. The system integrates 10+ tools for different functions and can accomplish a wide range of multimodal tasks, including processing complex images and long-form videos, understanding high-level queries, and handling flexible inputs.
