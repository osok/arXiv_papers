# SUMMARY
The study discusses data set distillation, a process to condense large data sets into smaller subsets while retaining essential features. The authors propose a curriculum learning framework for data set distillation on the ImageNet 21k data set, achieving impressive accuracy and outperforming prior methods.

# IDEAS:
- Data set distillation condenses large data sets into smaller, manageable subsets while preserving essential features.
- This process allows researchers with limited resources to participate in state-of-the-art model training.
- Data set distillation can address data privacy concerns by excluding personal data from the distilled set.
- Existing methods struggle to scale up to larger data sets like the full ImageNet 1K.
- The study explores handling the full ImageNet 21k data set for data set distillation.
- A curriculum learning framework is used to train on the complete ImageNet 21k.
- The approach starts by training a model to encapsulate knowledge from the original data sets.
- A refined training recipe improves results on ImageNet 21k during the data recovery phase.
- Strategic learning updates parts of images based on their difficulty using random resized crop data augmentation.
- Three learning paradigms are explored: standard curriculum learning, reverse curriculum learning, and constant learning.
- Curriculum learning introduces simpler concepts first, then gradually exposes more complex ones.
- Reverse curriculum learning starts with the most challenging tasks.
- Random resized crop ensures the model is exposed to different regions and scales of the original image.
- Curriculum data augmentation (CDA) simulates a curriculum learning procedure and is effective on large-scale data sets.
- Large models trained on large-scale data sets outperform smaller models and those trained on limited data.
- Extensive experiments were conducted on CIF, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet 1K, and ImageNet 21k data sets.
- The proposed approach achieves 63.2% accuracy on ImageNet 1K, surpassing previous methods.
- On ImageNet 21k, the method achieves a top-one accuracy of 35.3% using 50 times fewer training samples.
- The goal is to create synthetic data that results in minimal performance difference on original validation data.
- A strong baseline for data set distillation on large-scale data sets like ImageNet 21k is proposed.
- Decoupled training framework saves computation and memory consumption on large-scale ImageNet 21k.
- Curriculum training enhances the representational capability of synthetic data during synthesis.
- Post-training on larger models with stronger training recipes improves accuracy.
- Smaller batch sizes are crucial for post-training on synthetic data to achieve good accuracy.
- Gradient information from semantic class and pre-trained model predictions is used for data synthesis.
- Curriculum data synthesis stabilizes training, achieves better generalization, and reduces overfitting.
- The effectiveness of the approach is verified on various data sets, outperforming baseline methods.
- Curriculum schedulers (step, linear, cosine) manage lower limits on data cropped augmentation.
- Cosine scheduler outperforms linear scheduler in terms of accuracy towards the end.
- Smaller batch sizes improve performance on small-scale synthetic data sets but extend training times.
- Distilled data sets show less dependency on specific recovery models, reducing overfitting issues.
