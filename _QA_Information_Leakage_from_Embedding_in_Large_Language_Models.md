# SUMMARY
The paper discusses Federated Learning (FL) and its privacy concerns, particularly in large language models (LLMs). It introduces the Embed Parrot method for reconstructing original text from hidden states and evaluates its performance using various datasets.

# IDEAS:
- Federated Learning aims to train models across decentralized devices without exchanging local data.
- Privacy concerns arise from potential reconstruction attacks on gradient updates in FL settings.
- Embed Parrot reconstructs original input text from hidden states using a three-part architecture.
- The input adapter ensures hidden size compatibility with the decode model.
- The decode model, like GPT-2 XL, generates output embeddings.
- The output adapter converts the decode model's output to match the hidden size.
- Embed Parrot optimizes for cosine similarity between generated and original embeddings.
- Financial sentiment analysis dataset is used for training Embed Parrot.
- Financial question-answering dataset validates Embed Parrot's reconstructed inputs.
- Wikipedia-based dataset assesses Embed Parrot's generalizability across different data distributions.
- BEI method's performance varies between CHGM 6B and LLaMA 2 7B models.
- CHGM 6B shows better text reconstruction in early layers but declines in deeper layers.
- LLaMA 2 7B's text reconstruction improves with each subsequent layer.
- Different architectural designs of CHGM 6B and LLaMA 2 7B affect BEI performance.
- Overlap Matrix with DCT and IDCT obfuscates sensitive features of input embeddings.
- Random permutation of indices creates unique overlap matrices for embedding obfuscation.
- Overlap matrices are saved for consistent application across model development phases.
- Token length impacts Embed Parrot's performance in text reconstruction.
- CHGM 6B performs better with longer texts due to richer semantic information.
- LLaMA 2 7B maintains consistent performance across various token lengths.
- Embed Parrot shows slight decline in Rouge and F1 scores for certain token lengths.
- Semantic similarity remains high even if reconstructed tokens are not exact replicas.

# INSIGHTS:
- Federated Learning enables decentralized model training while addressing privacy concerns.
- Reconstruction attacks pose significant privacy risks in Federated Learning environments.
- Embed Parrot effectively reconstructs original text from hidden states, preserving privacy.
- Different models require tailored inversion strategies for optimal text reconstruction.
- Overlap Matrix with DCT/IDCT effectively obfuscates sensitive embedding features.
- Token length influences text reconstruction performance, with longer texts aiding better results.
