# SUMMARY
The paper explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in resolving GitHub issues, highlighting challenges and opportunities in code generation and issue resolution.

# IDEAS:
- LLMs face significant hurdles in line localization accuracy within Oracle settings.
- Low overlap ratio of line number ranges between generated and reference code changes.
- Logistic regression analysis shows a positive correlation between overlap ratio improvements and issue resolution success.
- Accurate line localization is crucial for enhancing the overall resolution process.
- Negative correlation between the number of modified files/functions and issue resolution probability.
- Claude 2 model demonstrates more efficient code change generation.
- Need to balance recall optimization and file selection for optimal performance in non-Oracle settings.
- Increased recall scores lead to decreased resolved ratio for Claude 2 model.
- Strategic file selection is necessary to maximize LLM performance.
- Majis framework introduced to streamline GitHub issue resolution process.
- Majis framework delineates roles of stakeholders and leverages LLMs for code generation and quality assurance.
- Framework aims to enhance collaboration and efficiency in issue resolution.
- Clear roadmap provided for leveraging LLM capabilities effectively.
- Challenges in accurately pinpointing lines requiring modification hinder efficiency.
- Importance of structured workflow in utilizing LLMs for issue resolution.
- Opportunities exist in improving LLM accuracy for better issue resolution outcomes.
- Emphasis on the need for strategic approaches in file selection and recall optimization.
- Majis framework enhances collaboration among stakeholders in the issue resolution process.
- LLMs can significantly impact the efficiency of GitHub issue resolution with proper strategies.
