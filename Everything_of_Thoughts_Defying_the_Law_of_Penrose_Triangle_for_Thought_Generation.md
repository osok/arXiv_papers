# SUMMARY
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved problem-solving by breaking down complex problems into smaller sequences called thoughts. The Everything of Thoughts (XOT) framework leverages reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance performance, efficiency, and flexibility in problem-solving tasks.
