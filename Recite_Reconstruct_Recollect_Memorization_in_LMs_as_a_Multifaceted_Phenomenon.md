# SUMMARY
The text introduces a taxonomy to categorize language model (LM) memorization behaviors into recitation, reconstruction, and recollection, inspired by human memorization.

# IDEAS:
- Taxonomy categorizes LM memorization into recitation, reconstruction, and recollection based on human memorization behaviors.
- Recitation involves duplicating sequences from training data verbatim.
- Reconstruction involves recreating passages based on learned patterns.
- Recollection involves sporadically remembering fragments not fitting other categories.
- Low perplexity is strongly linked to memorization likelihood.
- Larger models tend to memorize more data due to more parameters.
- Memorization increases with training time and model size.
- Recollection experiences the fastest growth in memorized sequences.
- Logistic regression models predict memorization for each category, outperforming baseline models.
- Low perplexity prompts facilitate recitation, while rare tokens constrain recollection.
- Memorization defined as generating next tokens verbatim when given the first K tokens.
- Factors influencing memorization include duplicates in training corpus, semantic similarity, textual variations, and token frequency.
- Templating refers to patterns in a sample like repeating sequences or incrementing numerical patterns.
- Compressibility measures how easily a sequence can be compressed.
- Perplexity calculates the average uncertainty in predicting tokens in a sequence.
- Larger models memorize rare sequences more effectively than smaller models.
- Smaller models excel at extrapolating repeating patterns.
- Repeated exposure to duplicated samples is not the primary driver of memorization growth.
- Notable increase in recollection category suggests focus on memorizing rarer sequences towards end of training.
- Sudden increase in reconstruction indicates breakthrough in generalizing complex patterns.
- Intuitive taxonomic model outperforms optimal partition model in predicting memorization outcomes.
- Rare sequences in recollection category more likely memorized if they do not contain rare tokens.
- Number of duplicates influences recollection candidate memorization but not recitation candidates.
- Beyond a certain threshold of duplicates, increased exposure does not lead to better memorization.
- Predictive model based on taxonomy outperforms generic baseline models.
