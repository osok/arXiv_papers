# SUMMARY
The paper addresses the "curse of diversity" in ensemble-based exploration, proposing Cross Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) to improve performance by enhancing representation learning.

# IDEAS:
- The curse of diversity refers to performance degradation in ensemble-based exploration due to off-policy learning challenges.
- CERL aims to mitigate the curse of diversity by improving representation learning within the ensemble.
- Each Q-value network in CERL is split into an encoder and a head to separate value function learning.
- CERL introduces an auxiliary task where each ensemble member learns the value functions of all other members.
- Parallel updates in CERL ensure each Q-value network encoder learns from all other ensemble members.
- CERL is computationally efficient and easy to implement, requiring minimal additional resources.
- Forcing Q-value network encoders to learn from all ensemble members improves representation learning.
- CERL preserves ensemble diversity while achieving representation learning effects similar to network sharing.
- Ensemble-based exploration enables concurrent exploration with multiple distinct policies without additional samples.
- Aggregating learned policies at test time can provide a robust ensemble policy through methods like majority voting.
- The curse of diversity leads to significant underperformance of individual ensemble members compared to single agents.
- Performance degradation in individual ensemble members is observed across various environments like Atari games and Mujoco tasks.
- Aggregating learned policies can sometimes fully compensate for individual performance loss, as seen in Walker 2D.
- The study challenges claims that enhanced performance of ensemble methods is primarily due to improved exploration.
- Benefits of ensemble methods often stem more from policy aggregation rather than exploration.
- Better ensemble algorithms are needed to mitigate performance degradation while leveraging ensemble advantages.
- CERL was tested on Bootstrap DQN in 55 Atari games and Ensemble SAC in four Mujoco tasks.
- CERL consistently mitigates the curse of diversity across tested environments, improving individual and aggregate policies.
- Applying CERL to Ensemble SAC in Humanoid significantly reduces the performance gap between SAC and Ensemble SAC.
- Improvements in individual policies due to CERL translate into enhancements in aggregate policies.
