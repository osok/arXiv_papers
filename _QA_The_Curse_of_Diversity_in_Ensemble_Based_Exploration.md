- CERL is computationally efficient and easy to implement.
- Representation learning in CERL enhances off-policy learning efficiency.
- CERL preserves ensemble diversity while improving representation learning.
- Ensemble-based exploration enables concurrent exploration with multiple distinct policies.
- Aggregating learned policies at test time can boost performance.
- Individual ensemble members often underperform compared to single-agent counterparts.
- Performance degradation in ensemble-based exploration challenges previous claims about improved exploration.
- Policy aggregation often compensates for individual performance loss in ensembles.

- CERL was tested on Bootstrap DQN in 55 Atari games and Ensemble SAC in four Mujoco tasks.
- CERL consistently mitigates the curse of diversity across tested environments.
- Improvements in individual policies due to CERL translate into better aggregate policies.
- The paper highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the curse of diversity.
