# SUMMARY
Gecko, a versatile text embedding model, leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance embedding quality, achieving top performance on the MTE Benchmark.

# IDEAS:
- Text embedding models represent natural language as dense vectors to group similar text together.
- These models are used for document retrieval, sentence similarity, and classification tasks.
- Recent efforts aim to develop a single model that can handle multiple tasks.
- General-purpose models require large training data to cover various domains effectively.
- Large language models (LLMs) offer extensive knowledge across different domains.
- LLMs excel at learning from a few examples.
- Gecko leverages LLMs to generate tasks and queries for passages.
- Reranking passages using an LLM is crucial for selecting positive and negative passages.
- Combining LLM-generated data with human-annotated data improves model performance.
- Gecko 1B with 768-dimensional embeddings outperforms other models on the MTE Benchmark.
- Pre-fine-tuning and fine-tuning stages are used in Gecko's training process.
- FRET (Few-shot Prompted Retrieval Data Set) includes positive and hard negative passages for each query.
- Pre-fine-tuning involves self-supervised tasks on a large text corpus.
- Contrastive learning objective is optimized with in-batch negatives for each mini-batch.
- LLMs generate diverse queries by reading web passages and creating task descriptions.
- LLM-based methods improve positive and negative mining processes.
- Query likelihood and relevance classification are used for ranking passages.
- Reciprocal rank fusion enhances model performance across various tasks.
- Gecko excels in balancing retrieval and semantic textual similarity performance.
- Multilingual version of Gecko achieves superior performance on multilingual tasks.
- Using the most relevant passage chosen by an LLM is more effective than the original passage.
- FRET offers queries for various tasks like question answering, search results, fact-checking, and sentence similarity.
- Unified format significantly influences the quality of embeddings.
- Combining classification data sets boosts performance without significant decline in other tasks.
