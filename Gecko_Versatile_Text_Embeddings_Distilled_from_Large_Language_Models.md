- Gecko uses a 1.2 billion parameter pre-trained Transformer language model for its foundation.
- The Fret dataset includes positive and hard negative passages for each query, enhancing model training.
- Pre-fine-tuning involves self-supervised tasks on a large text corpus to expose the model to diverse data.
- Contrastive learning objective with in-batch negatives optimizes contextualized token embeddings for text pairs.
- LLMs generate diverse queries by reading web passages and creating task descriptions and relevant queries.
- Gecko's training recipe includes pre-fine-tuning and fine-tuning stages for effective model training.
- LLM-based methods improve positive and negative mining by finding more relevant passages for generated queries.
- Query likelihood and relevance classification are used to rank passages based on their relevance to the query.
- Reciprocal rank fusion enhances model performance by combining different ranking methods.
- Gecko outperforms other models on the MTE Benchmark, excelling in retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks.
- Multilingual version of Gecko achieves superior performance on multilingual tasks despite Fret being in English.
- Using the most relevant passage chosen by an LLM is more effective than using the original passage as a positive target.
