# SUMMARY
Researchers introduce the Flexible Length Question Answering (FLE-QA) dataset to study how large language models (LLMs) handle reasoning tasks with varying input lengths, revealing significant performance drops with longer inputs.

# IDEAS:
- Large language models (LLMs) can handle complex questions requiring multiple steps of reasoning.
- LLMs struggle with longer inputs, even if they are technically equipped to handle them.
- Performance drops in LLMs may be due to input length or task complexity.
- The Flexible Length Question Answering (FLE-QA) dataset isolates input length impact on model performance.
- FLE-QA includes true/false questions requiring understanding two pieces of information.
- Models must use the entire input to answer correctly in FLE-QA.
- LLMs experience a significant drop in reasoning capabilities with inputs as short as 3,000 tokens.
- Average accuracy falls from 92% to 68% across all models tested.
- Placement of relevant information within the text affects model performance.
- A model's ability to predict the next word does not correlate with reasoning performance on long inputs.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting improves performance on short inputs but not on longer ones.
- GP4 shows a widening gap between CoT and standard prompting with longer inputs.
- Models often ignore specific instructions with longer inputs, providing no answer or incomplete reasoning steps.
- There is a bias towards false answers as input length increases.
- The reasoning required is independent of the input's length in FLE-QA tasks.
- FLE-QA tasks include monotone relations, people in rooms, and a simplified version of Ru-taker.
- Key paragraphs in FLE-QA are created by expanding simple sentences into coherent paragraphs using GP4.
- Models perform well on minimal text needed for answering questions without complex prompting strategies.
- Adding irrelevant text significantly reduces model performance.
- Placing key paragraphs together generally leads to better performance.
- Accuracy declines noticeably when input length exceeds 500 tokens.
- Non-adjacent key paragraphs make reasoning tasks more challenging for LLMs.
- Irrelevant paragraphs different from relevant ones do not aid models in focusing on key information.
- Next word prediction accuracy negatively correlates with reasoning performance on long texts.
- CoT prompting does not counteract performance decline with longer inputs for most models.
- Incorrect responses often link to failure in covering necessary facts in longer inputs.
- Evaluating model performance based on a single input length does not offer a complete understanding of its capabilities.
