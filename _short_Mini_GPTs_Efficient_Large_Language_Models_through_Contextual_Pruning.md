# SUMMARY
The paper evaluates a pruning methodology for GPT-like models across diverse datasets, focusing on neuron outputs, activation functions, and embeddings.

# IDEAS:
- Pruning methodology evaluated across diverse datasets using GPT-like architectures such as Phi 1.5, LMA 1.3.
- Initial models include pre-trained Transformers developed by Microsoft and Meta with customized BPE tokenizer.
- Detailed contextual analysis for pruning involves scrutinizing neuron outputs across linear layers and activation functions.
- Weights less crucial for maintaining performance in specific domains are identified for pruning.
- Linear layers are pruned by selecting neurons based on their normalized L1 Norms.
- Pruning threshold is denoted as Epsilon uncore T, identifying unused rows and columns in weight matrix.
- Activation layers are pruned by targeting non-essential activation neurons based on normalized L1 Norms.
- Focus on pruning jelu and relu layers in the activation layers.
- Embedding layers are pruned using token frequency of a dataset to guide the process.
- Very large calibration sets are needed to effectively prune embeddings.
- Pruned mini GPTs are evaluated using perplexity and multiple-choice question (MCQ) testing.
- Perplexity measures the model's ability to predict the next word given context.
- Pruned models perform comparably or better than their unpruned versions.
- Larger pruning thresholds explored to determine limits of pruning methodology.
- Potential size reduction of up to 41.88% with the FI model while maintaining perplexity.
- Some models struggle to recover perplexity and take more epochs to recover with larger pruning thresholds.
- Further testing suggested to determine if overfitting can be mitigated with larger, more representative datasets.
- English to Taiwanese dataset results indicate MCQ accuracy increased after fine-tuning.

# INSIGHTS

- Pruned models can perform comparably or better than unpruned versions in perplexity and MCQ tests.
- Larger pruning thresholds may lead to difficulties in recovering perplexity, requiring more epochs.
- Fine-tuning can improve MCQ accuracy, as seen in the English to Taiwanese dataset results.
