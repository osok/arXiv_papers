# SUMMARY
The paper evaluates a pruning methodology for GPT-like models across diverse datasets, focusing on neuron outputs, activation functions, and embeddings.

# IDEAS:
- Collection of diverse datasets from various domains is the first step.
- Initial models selected include GPT-like architectures such as Phi 1.5, LMA 1.3, and OPT 1.3.
- Pre-trained Transformers developed by Microsoft and Meta are used.
- Customized Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer and Hugging Face are employed.
- Detailed contextual analysis for pruning involves scrutinizing neuron outputs.
- Neuron outputs across linear layers, activation functions, and embeddings are analyzed.
- Weights less crucial for maintaining performance in specific domains are identified.
- Pruning is most effective in areas pinpointed by the analysis.
- Linear layers are pruned based on normalized L1 norms of neurons.
- Pruning threshold is denoted as Epsilon uncore T.
- Unused rows and columns in the weight matrix of the linear layer are identified.
- Activation layers are pruned, focusing on non-essential activation neurons.
- JELU and ReLU layers are primarily targeted in activation layer pruning.
- Embedding layers are pruned using token frequency of a dataset.
- Very large calibration sets are needed to effectively prune embeddings.
- Pruned mini GPTs are evaluated using perplexity and multiple-choice question (MCQ) testing.
- Perplexity measures the model's ability to predict the next word given context.
- Pruned models perform comparably or better than their unpruned versions.
- Larger pruning thresholds are explored to test the limits of the methodology.
- Potential size reduction of up to 41.88% with the FI model while maintaining perplexity.
- Some models struggle to recover perplexity and take more epochs to recover with larger thresholds.
- Further testing is suggested to determine if overfitting can be mitigated with larger datasets.
- English to Taiwanese dataset results indicate increased MCQ accuracy after fine-tuning.

# INSIGHTS:
- Pruning methodology can significantly reduce model size while maintaining performance.
- Detailed contextual analysis is crucial for effective pruning.
- Larger calibration sets improve embedding pruning effectiveness.
- Pruned models can perform better than unpruned versions in some cases.
- Larger pruning thresholds may lead to overfitting or slower recovery of perplexity.
