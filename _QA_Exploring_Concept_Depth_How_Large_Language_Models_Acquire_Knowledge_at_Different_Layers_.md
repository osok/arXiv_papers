# SUMMARY
The paper introduces the concept of "concept depth" to measure how large language models (LLMs) understand knowledge at various depths within their networks. It aims to investigate how LLMs encode concepts of different complexities and the relationship between model depth and conceptual understanding.

# IDEAS:
- Concept depth measures where LLMs understand knowledge at various levels within their network depths.
- Basic concepts are typically learned at lower levels of the network.
- More complex concepts require deeper layers for understanding.
- Concept depth provides a new perspective on how LLMs learn and process information.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments using probe techniques to measure concept depth.
- Different families of open-source models used include Gemma, Llama, and Quen.
- Models are categorized based on size, ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters.
- Data sets are categorized into easy and complex based on LLM performance.
- Easy data sets show high accuracy early on; complex data sets require deeper layers.
- Adding noise to input questions tests the robustness of LLMs' internal representations.
- Noise perturbation can affect the model's performance and learning curve.
- Reducing precision to 8 bits slows down convergence; 16-bit compression is suggested.
- Linear classifier probing quantifies differences in hidden feature sets of LLMs.
- Metrics like variation rate, jump point, and converging point capture accuracy variations.
